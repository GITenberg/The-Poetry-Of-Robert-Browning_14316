<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3><i>BROWNING AND TENNYSON</i></h3>
<p>Parnassus, Apollo's mount, has two peaks, and on these, for
sixty years, from 1830 to 1890,<a name='FNanchor_1_1' id=
"FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href='#Footnote_1_1'>[1]</a> two poets sat,
till their right to these lofty peaks became unchallenged. Beneath
them, during these years, on the lower knolls of the mount of song,
many new poets sang; with diverse instruments, on various subjects,
and in manifold ways. They had their listeners; the Muses were also
their visitants; but none of them ventured seriously to dispute the
royal summits where Browning and Tennyson sat, and smiled at one
another across the vale between.</p>
<p>Both began together; and the impulses which came to them from
the new and excited world which opened its fountains in and about
1832 continued to impel them till the close of their lives. While
the poetic world altered around them, while two generations of
poets made new schools of poetry, they remained, for the most part,
unaffected <a name='Page2' id="Page2"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>2</span>by these schools. There is nothing of Arnold and
Clough, of Swinburne, Rossetti or Morris, or of any of the others,
in Browning or Tennyson. There is nothing even of Mrs. Browning in
Browning. What changes took place in them were wrought, first, by
the natural growth of their own character; secondly, by the natural
development of their art-power; and thirdly, by the slow decaying
of that power. They were, in comparison with the rest, curiously
uninfluenced by the changes of the world around them. The main
themes, with which they began, they retained to the end. Their
methods, their instruments, their way of feeling into the world of
man and of nature, their relation to the doctrines of God and of
Man, did not, though on all these matters they held diverse views,
alter with the alteration of the world. But this is more true of
Browning than of Tennyson. The political and social events of those
years touched Tennyson, as we see from <i>Maud</i> and the
<i>Princess</i>, but his way of looking at them was not the way of
a contemporary. It might have been predicted from his previous
career and work. Then the new movements of Science and Criticism
which disturbed Clough and Arnold so deeply, also troubled
Tennyson, but not half so seriously. He staggered for a time under
the attack on his old conceptions, but he never yielded to it. He
was angry with himself for every doubt that beset him, and angry
with the Science and Criticism which disturbed the ancient ideas he
was determined not to change. Finally, he rested where he had been
when he wrote <i>In Memoriam</i>, nay more, where he had been when
he began to write.</p>
<p><a name='Page3' id="Page3"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>3</span>There were no such intervals in Browning's
thought. One could scarcely say from his poetry, except in a very
few places, that he was aware of the social changes of his time, or
of the scientific and critical movement which, while he lived, so
profoundly modified both theology and religion.<a name=
'FNanchor_2_2' id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href=
'#Footnote_2_2'>[2]</a> <i>Asolando</i>, in 1890, strikes the same
chords, but more feebly, which <i>Paracelsus</i> struck in
1835.</p>
<p>But though, in this lofty apartness and self-unity, Browning and
Tennyson may fairly be said to be at one, in themselves and in
their song they were different. There could scarcely be two
characters, two musics, two minds, two methods in art, two
imaginations, more distinct and contrasted than those which lodged
in these men&mdash;and the object of this introduction is to bring
out this contrast, with the purpose of placing in a clearer light
some of the peculiar elements in the poetry of Browning, and in his
position as a poet.</p>
<p>1. Their public fate was singularly different. In 1842 Tennyson,
with his two volumes of Collected Poems, made his position. The
<i>Princess</i>, in 1847, increased his reputation. In 1850, <i>In
Memoriam</i> <a name='Page4' id="Page4"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>4</span>raised him, it was said, above all the poets of
his time, and the book was appreciated, read and loved by the
greater part of the English-speaking world. The success and popular
fame which now followed were well deserved and wisely borne. They
have endured and will endure. A host of imitators, who caught his
music and his manner, filled the groves and ledges which led up to
the peak on which he lived. His side of Parnassus was thronged.</p>
<p>It was quite otherwise with his brother-poet. Only a few
clear-eyed persons cared to read <i>Paracelsus</i>, which appeared
in 1835. <i>Strafford</i>, Browning's first drama, had a little
more vogue; it was acted for a while. When <i>Sordello</i>, that
strange child of genius, was born in 1840, those who tried to read
its first pages declared they were incomprehensible. It seems that
critics in those days had either less intelligence than we have, or
were more impatient and less attentive, for not only
<i>Sordello</i> but even <i>In Memoriam</i> was said to be
exceedingly obscure.</p>
<p>Then, from 1841 to 1846, Browning published at intervals a
series of varied poems and dramas, under the title of <i>Bells and
Pomegranates</i>. These, one might imagine, would have grasped the
heart of any public which had a care for poetry. Among them were
such diverse poems as <i>Pippa Passes; A Blot in the 'Scutcheon;
Saul; The Pied Piper of Hamelin; My Last Duchess; Waring</i>. I
only mention a few (all different in note, subject and manner from
one another), in order to mark the variety and range of imaginative
power displayed in this wonderful set of little books. The <a name=
'Page5' id="Page5"></a><span class='pagenum'>5</span>Bells of
poetry's music, hung side by side with the golden Pomegranates of
thought, made the fringe of the robe of this high priest of song.
Rarely have imagination and intellect, ideal faith and the sense
which handles daily life, passion and quietude, the impulse and
self-mastery of an artist, the joy of nature and the fates of men,
grave tragedy and noble grotesque, been mingled together more
fully&mdash;bells for the pleasure and fruit for the food of
man.</p>
<p>Yet, on the whole, they fell dead on the public. A few, however,
loved them, and all the poems were collected in 1849. <i>In
Memoriam</i> and this Collected Edition of Browning issued almost
together; but with how different a fate and fame we see most
plainly in the fact that Browning can scarcely be said to have had
any imitators. The groves and ledges of his side of Apollo's
mountain were empty, save for a few enchanted listeners, who said:
"This is our music, and here we build our tent."</p>
<p>As the years went on, these readers increased in number, but
even when the volumes entitled <i>Men and Women</i> were published
in 1855, and the <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i> in 1864, his
followers were but a little company. For all this neglect Browning
cared as a bird cares who sings for the love of singing, and who
never muses in himself whether the wood is full or not of
listeners. Being always a true artist, he could not stop versing
and playing; and not one grain of villain envy touched his happy
heart when he looked across the valley to Tennyson. He loved his
mistress Art, and his love made him always joyful in creating.</p>
<p><a name='Page6' id="Page6"></a><span class='pagenum'>6</span>At
last his time came, but it was not till nearly twenty years after
the Collected Poems of 1849 that <i>The Ring and the Book</i>
astonished the reading public so much by its intellectual <i>tour
de force</i> that it was felt to be unwise to ignore Browning any
longer. His past work was now discovered, read and praised. It was
not great success or worldwide fame that he attained, but it was
pleasant to him, and those who already loved his poems rejoiced
with him. Before he died he was widely read, never so much as
Tennyson, but far more than he had ever expected. It had become
clear to all the world that he sat on a rival height with Tennyson,
above the rest of his fellow-poets.</p>
<p>Their public fate, then, was very different. Tennyson had fifty
years of recognition, Browning barely ten. And to us who now know
Browning this seems a strange thing. Had he been one of the smaller
men, a modern specialist like Arnold or Rossetti, we could better
understand it. But Browning's work was not limited to any
particular or temporary phase of human nature. He set himself to
represent, as far as he could, all types of human nature; and, more
audacious still, types taken from many diverse ages, nations and
climates. He told us of times and folk as far apart as Caliban and
Cleon, as Karshish and Waring, as Balaustion and Fifine, as St.
John and Bishop Blougram. The range and the contrasts of his
subjects are equally great. And he did this work with a searching
analysis, a humorous keenness, a joyous boldness, and an opulent
imagination at once penetrative and passionate. When, then, we
realise this as we realise it now, we are the more astonished
<a name='Page7' id="Page7"></a><span class='pagenum'>7</span>that
appreciation of him lingered so long. Why did it not come at first,
and why did it come in the end?</p>
<p>The first answer to that question is a general one. During the
years between 1860 and 1890, and especially during the latter half
of these years, science and criticism were predominant. Their
determination to penetrate to the roots of things made a change in
the general direction of thought and feeling on the main subjects
of life. Analysis became dearer to men than synthesis, reasoning
than imagination. Doubtful questions were submitted to intellectual
decision alone. The Understanding, to its great surprise, was
employed on the investigation of the emotions, and even the artists
were drawn in this direction. They, too, began to dissect the human
heart. Poets and writers of fiction, students of human nature, were
keenly interested, not so much in our thoughts and feelings as in
exposing how and why we thought or felt in this or that fashion. In
such analysis they seemed to touch the primal sources of life. They
desired to dig about the tree of humanity and to describe all the
windings of its roots and fibres&mdash;not much caring whether
they withered the tree for a time&mdash;rather than to describe and
sing its outward beauty, its varied foliage, and its ruddy fruit.
And this liking to investigate the hidden inwardness of
motives&mdash;which many persons, weary of self-contemplation,
wisely prefer to keep hidden&mdash;ran through the practice of all
the arts. They became, on the whole, less emotional, more
intellectual. The close marriage between passion and thought,
without whose cohabitation no work <a name='Page8' id=
"Page8"></a><span class='pagenum'>8</span>of genius is born in the
arts, was dissolved; and the intellect of the artist often worked
by itself, and his emotion by itself. Some of the parthenogenetic
children of these divorced powers were curious products, freaks,
even monsters of literature, in which the dry, cynical, or
vivisecting temper had full play, or the naked, lustful, or cruel
exposure of the emotions in ugly, unnatural, or morbid forms was
glorified. They made an impudent claim to the name of Art, but they
were nothing better than disagreeable Science. But this was an
extreme deviation of the tendency. The main line it took was not so
detestable. It was towards the ruthless analysis of life, and of
the soul of man; a part, in fact, of the general scientific
movement. The outward forms of things charmed writers less than the
motives which led to their making. The description of the tangled
emotions and thoughts of the inner life, before any action took
place, was more pleasurable to the writer, and easier, than any
description of their final result in act. This was borne to a
wearisome extreme in fiction, and in these last days a comfortable
reaction from it has arisen. In poetry it did not last so long.
Morris carried us out of it. But long before it began, long before
its entrance into the arts, Browning, who on another side of his
genius delighted in the representation of action, anticipated in
poetry, and from the beginning of his career, twenty, even thirty
years before it became pronounced in literature, this tendency to
the intellectual analysis of human nature. When he began it, no one
cared for it; and <i>Paracelsus, Sordello</i> and the
soul-dissecting poems in <i>Bells and <a name='Page9' id=
"Page9"></a><span class='pagenum'>9</span>Pomegranates</i> fell on
an unheeding world. But Browning did not heed the unheeding of the
world. He had the courage of his aims in art, and while he
frequently shaped in his verse the vigorous movement of life, even
to its moments of fierce activity, he went on quietly, amid the
silence of the world, to paint also the slowly interwoven and
complex pattern of the inner life of men. And then, when the
tendency of which I speak had collared the interest of society,
society, with great and ludicrous amazement, found him out. "Here
is a man," it said, "who has been doing in poetry for the last
thirty years the very thing of which we are so fond, and who is
doing it with delightful and varied subtlety. We will read him
now." So Browning, anticipating by thirty years the drift of the
world, was not read at first; but, afterwards, the world having
reached him, he became a favoured poet.</p>
<p>However, fond as he was of metaphysical analysis, he did not
fall into the extremes into which other writers carried it,
<i>Paracelsus</i> is, indeed, entirely concerned with the inner
history of a soul, but <i>Sordello</i> combines with a similar
history a tale of political and warlike action in which men and
women, like Salinguerra and Palma, who live in outward work rather
than in inward thought, are described; while in poems like <i>Pippa
Passes</i> and some of the Dramas, emotion and thought, intimately
interwoven, are seen blazing, as it were, into a lightning of swift
deeds. Nor are other poems wanting, in which, not long analysis,
but short passion, fiery outbursts of thought, taking immediate
form, are represented with astonishing intensity.</p>
<p><a name='Page10' id="Page10"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>10</span>2. This second remarkable power of his touches
the transition which has begun to carry us, in the last few years,
from the subjective to the objective in art. The time came, and
quite lately, when art, weary of intellectual and minute
investigation, turned to realise, not the long inward life of a
soul with all its motives laid bare, but sudden moments of human
passion, swift and unoutlined impressions on the senses, the moody
aspects of things, flared-out concentrations of critical hours of
thought and feeling which years perhaps of action and emotion had
brought to the point of eruption. Impressionism was born in
painting, poetry, sculpture and music.</p>
<p>It was curious that, when we sought for a master who had done
this in the art of poetry, we found that Browning&mdash;who had in
long poems done the very opposite of impressionism&mdash;had also,
in a number of short poems, anticipated impressionist art by nearly
forty years. <i>Porphyria's Lover</i>, many a scene in <i>Sordello,
My Last Duchess, The Laboratory, Home Thoughts from Abroad</i>, are
only a few out of many. It is pleasant to think of the ultimate
appearance of Waring, flashed out for a moment on the sea, only to
disappear. In method, swiftness and colour, but done in verse, it
is an impressionist picture, as vivid in transient scenery as in
colour. He did the same sort of work in poems of nature, of human
life, of moments of passion, of states of the soul. That is another
reason why he was not read at first, and why he is read now. He was
impressionist long before Impressionism arrived. When it arrived he
was found out. And he stood alone, for Tennyson is <a name='Page11'
id="Page11"></a><span class='pagenum'>11</span>never impressionist,
and never could have been. Neither was Swinburne nor Arnold, Morris
nor Rossetti.</p>
<p>3. Again, in the leisured upper ranges of thought and emotion,
and in the extraordinary complexity of human life which arose,
first, out of the more intimate admixture of all classes in our
society; and secondly, out of the wider and more varied world-life
which increased means of travel and knowledge afforded to men,
Tennyson's smooth, melodious, simple development of art-subjects
did not represent the clashing complexity of human life, whether
inward in the passions, the intellect or the soul, or in the active
movement of the world. And the other poets were equally incapable
of representing this complexity of which the world became clearly
conscious. Arnold tried to express its beginnings, and failed,
because he tried to explain instead of representing them. He wrote
about them; he did not write them down. Nor did he really belong to
this novel, quick, variegated, involved world which was so pleased
with its own excitement and entanglement. He was the child of a
world which was then passing away, out of which life was fading,
which was tired like Obermann, and sought peace in reflective
solitudes. Sometimes he felt, as in <i>The New Age</i>, the
pleasure of the coming life of the world, but he was too weary to
share in it, and he claimed quiet. But chiefly he saw the
disturbance, the unregulated life; and, unable to realise that it
was the trouble and wildness of youth, he mistook it for the
trouble of decay. He painted it as such. But it was really young,
and out of it broke all kinds of experiments in social, <a name=
'Page12' id="Page12"></a><span class='pagenum'>12</span>religious,
philosophical and political thought, such as we have seen and read
of for the last thirty years. Art joined in the experiments of this
youthful time. It opened a new fountain and sent forth from it
another stream, to echo this attempting, clanging and complicated
society; and this stream did not flow like a full river, making
large or sweet melody, but like a mountain torrent thick with
rocks, the thunderous whirlpools of whose surface were white with
foam. Changing and sensational scenery haunted its lower banks
where it became dangerously navigable. Strange boats, filled with
outlandish figures, who played on unknown instruments, and sang of
deeds and passions remote from common life, sailed by on its stormy
waters. Few were the concords, many the discords, and some of the
discords were never resolved. But in one case at least&mdash;in the
case of Browning's poetry, and in very many cases in the art of
music&mdash;out of the discords emerged at last a full melody of
steady thought and controlled emotion as (to recapture my original
metaphor) the rude, interrupted music of the mountain stream
reaches full and concordant harmony when it flows in peace through
the meadows of the valley.</p>
<p>These complex and intercleaving conditions of thought and
passion into which society had grown Browning represented from
almost the beginning of his work. When society became conscious of
them&mdash;there it found him. And, amazed, it said, "Here is a man
who forty years ago lived in the midst of our present life and
wrote about it." They saw the wild, loud complexity of their world
expressed in his verse; and yet were dimly <a name='Page13' id=
"Page13"></a><span class='pagenum'>13</span>conscious, to their
consolation, that he was aware of a central peace where the noise
was quieted and the tangle unravelled.</p>
<p>For Browning not only represented this discordant, varied
hurly-burly of life, but also, out of all the discords which he
described, and which, when he chose, even his rhythms and
word-arrangements realised in sound, he drew a concordant melody at
last, and gave to a world, troubled with itself, the hope of a
great concent into which all the discords ran, and where they were
resolved. And this hope for the individual and the race was one of
the deepest elements in Browning's religion. It was also the hope
of Tennyson, but Tennyson was often uncertain of it, and bewailed
the uncertainty. Browning was certain of his hope, and for the most
part resolved his discords. Even when he did not resolve them, he
firmly believed that they would be resolved. This, his essential
difference from the other poets of the last fifty years, marks not
only his apartness from the self-ignorance of English society, and
the self-sceptical scepticism which arises from that
self-ignorance, but also how steadily assured was the foundation of
his spiritual life. In the midst of the shifting storms of doubt
and trouble, of mockery, contradiction, and assertion on religious
matters, he stood unremoved. Whatever men may think of his faith
and his certainties, they reveal the strength of his character, the
enduring courage of his soul, and the inspiring joyousness that,
born of his strength, characterised him to the last poem he wrote.
While the other poets were tossing on the sea of unresolved
Question, he rested, musing and creating, <a name='Page14' id=
"Page14"></a><span class='pagenum'>14</span>on a green island whose
rocks were rooted on the ocean-bed, and wondered, with the smiling
tolerance of his life-long charity, how his fellows were of so
little faith, and why the sceptics made so much noise. He would
have reversed the Psalmist's cry. He would have said, "Thou art not
cast down, O my soul; thou art not disquieted within me. Thou hast
hoped in God, who is the light of thy countenance, and thy
God."</p>
<p>At first the world, enamoured of its own complex discords, and
pleased, like boys in the street, with the alarms it made, only
cared for that part of Browning which represented the tangle and
the clash, and ignored his final melody. But of late it has begun,
tired of the restless clatter of intellectual atoms, to desire to
hear, if possible, the majestic harmonies in which the discords are
resolved. And at this point many at present and many more in the
future will find their poetic and religious satisfaction in
Browning. At the very end, then, of the nineteenth century, in a
movement which had only just begun, men said to themselves,
"Browning felt beforehand what we are beginning to hope for, and
wrote of it fifty, even sixty years ago. No one cared then for him,
but we care now."</p>
<p>Again, though he thus anticipated the movements of the world, he
did not, like the other poets, change his view about Nature, Man
and God. He conceived that view when he was young, and he did not
alter it. Hence, he did not follow or reflect from year to year the
opinions of his time on these great matters. When <i>Paracelsus</i>
was published in 1835 Browning had fully thought out, and in that
<a name='Page15' id="Page15"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>15</span>poem fully expressed, his theory of God's
relation to man, and of man's relation to the universe around him,
to his fellow men, and to the world beyond. It was a theory which
was original, if any theory can be so called. At least, its form,
as he expressed it, was clearly original. Roughly sketched in
<i>Pauline</i>, fully rounded in <i>Paracelsus</i>, it held and
satisfied his mind till the day of his death. But Tennyson had no
clear theory about Man or Nature or God when he began, nor was he
afterwards, save perhaps when he wrote the last stanzas of <i>In
Memoriam</i>, a fully satisfied citizen of the city that has
foundations. He believed in that city, but he could not always live
in it. He grew into this or that opinion about the relations of God
and man, and then grew out of it. He held now this, now that view
of nature, and of man in contact with nature. There was always
battle in his soul; although he won his brittle in the end, he had
sixty years of war. Browning was at peace, firm-fixed. It is true
the inward struggle of Tennyson enabled him to image from year to
year his own time better than Browning did. It is true this
struggle enabled him to have great variety in his art-work when it
was engaged with the emotions which belong to doubt and faith; but
it also made him unable to give to his readers that sense of things
which cannot be shaken, of faith in God and in humanity wholly
independent, in its depths, of storms on the surface of this mortal
life, which was one of Browning's noblest legacies to that
wavering, faithless, pessimistic, analysis-tormented world through
which we have fought our way, and out of which we are emerging.</p>
<p><a name='Page16' id="Page16"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>16</span>4. The danger in art, or for an artist, of so
settled a theory is that in expression it tends to monotony; and
sometimes, when we find almost every poem of Browning's running up
into his theory, we arrive at the borders of the Land of Weary-men.
But he seems to have been aware of this danger, and to have
conquered it. He meets it by the immense variety of the subjects he
chooses, and of the scenery in which he places them. I do not think
he ever repeats any one of his examples, though he always repeats
his theory. And the pleasant result is that we can either ignore
the theory if we like, or rejoice over its universal application,
or, beyond it altogether, be charmed and excited by the fresh
examples alone. And they are likely to charm, at least by variety,
for they are taken from all ages of history; from as many diverse
phases of human act, character and passion as there are poems which
concern them; from many periods of the arts; from most of the
countries of Europe, from France, Germany, Spain, Italy, (rarely
from England,) with their specialised types of race and of
landscape; and from almost every class of educated modern society.
Moreover, he had a guard within his own nature against the danger
of this monotony. It was the youthful freshness with which, even in
advanced age, he followed his rapid impulses to art-creation. No
one was a greater child than he in the quickness with which he
received a sudden call to poetry from passing events or scenes, and
in the eagerness with which he seized them as subjects. He took the
big subjects now and then which the world expects to be taken, and
treated them with <a name='Page17' id="Page17"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>17</span>elaborate thought and steadfast feeling, but he
was more often like the girl in his half-dramatic poem, whom the
transient occurrences and sights of the day touched into song. He
picked up his subjects as a man culls flowers in a mountain walk,
moved by an ever-recurring joy and fancy in them&mdash;a book on a
stall, a bust in an Italian garden, a face seen at the opera, the
market chatter of a Tuscan town, a story told by the roadside in
Brittany, a picture in some Accademia&mdash;so that, though the
ground-thought might incur the danger of dulness through
repetition, the joy of the artist so filled the illustration, and
his freshness of invention was so delighted with itself, that even
to the reader the theory seemed like a new star.</p>
<p>In this way he kept the use of having an unwavering basis of
thought which gave unity to his sixty years of work, and yet
avoided the peril of monotony. An immense diversity animated his
unity, filled it with gaiety and brightness, and secured
impulsiveness of fancy. This also differentiates him from Tennyson,
who often wanted freshness; who very rarely wrote on a sudden
impulse, but after long and careful thought; to whose seriousness
we cannot always climb with pleasure; who played so little with the
world. These defects in Tennyson had the excellences which belong
to them in art, just as these excellences in Browning had, in art,
their own defects. We should be grateful for the excellences, and
not trouble ourselves about the defects. However, neither the
excellences nor the defects concern us in the present discussion.
It is the contrast between the two men on which we dwell.</p>
<p><a name='Page18' id="Page18"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>18</span>5. The next point of contrast, which will
further illustrate why Browning was not read of old but is now
read, has to do with historical criticism. There arose, some time
ago, as part of the scientific and critical movement of the last
forty years, a desire to know and record accurately the early life
of peoples, pastoral, agricultural and in towns, and the beginning
of their arts and knowledges; and not only their origins, but the
whole history of their development. A close, critical investigation
was made of the origins of each people; accurate knowledge, derived
from contemporary documents, of their life, laws, customs and
language was attained; the facts of their history were separated
from their mythical and legendary elements; the dress, the looks of
men, the climate of the time, the physical aspects of their
country&mdash;all the skeleton of things was fitted together, bone
to bone. And for a good while this merely critical school held the
field. It did admirable and necessary work.</p>
<p>But when it was done, art claimed its place in this work. The
desire sprang up among historians to conceive all this history in
the imagination, to shape vividly its scenery, to animate and
individualise its men and women, to paint the life of the human
soul in it, to clothe it in flesh and blood, to make its feet move
and its eyes flash&mdash;but to do all these things within the
limits of the accurate knowledge which historical criticism had
defined. "Let us saturate ourselves," said the historians, "with
clear knowledge of the needful facts, and then, without violation
of our knowledge, imagine the human life, the landscape, the
thinking and <a name='Page19' id="Page19"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>19</span>feeling of a prim&aelig;val man, of his early
religion, of his passions; of Athens when the Persian came, of Rome
when the Republic was passing into the Empire, of a Provincial in
Spain or Britain, of a German town in the woods by the river. Let
us see in imagination as well as in knowledge an English settlement
on the Welsh border, an Italian medi&aelig;val town when its art
was being born, a Jewish village when Christ wandered into its
streets, a musician or a painter's life at a time when Greek art
was decaying, or when a new impulse like the Renaissance or the
French Revolution came upon the world." When that effort of the
historians had established itself, and we have seen it from
blossoming to fruitage, people began to wonder that no poet had
ever tried to do this kind of work. It seemed eminently fitted for
a poet's hand, full of subjects alluring to the penetrative
imagination. It needed, of course, some scholarship, for it
demanded accuracy in its grasp of the main ideas of the time to be
represented; but that being given, immense opportunities remained
for pictures of human life, full of colour, thought and passions;
for subtle and brilliant representations of the eternal desires and
thinkings of human nature as they were governed by the special
circumstances of the time in which the poem was placed; and for the
concentration into a single poem, gathered round one person, of the
ideas whose new arrival formed a crisis in the history of art.</p>
<p>Men looked for this in Tennyson and did not find it. His Greek
and medi&aelig;val poems were modernised. Their imaginative work
was uncritical. <a name='Page20' id="Page20"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>20</span>But when the historians and the critics of art
and of religious movements happened at last to look into Browning,
they discovered, to their delight and wonder, that he had been
doing, with a curious knowledge, this kind of work for many years.
He had anticipated the results of that movement of the imagination
in historical work which did not exist when he began to write; he
had worked that mine, and the discovery of this made another host
of people readers of his poetry.</p>
<p>We need scarcely give examples of this. <i>Sordello</i>, in 1840
(long before the effort of which we speak began), was such a
poem&mdash;the history of a specialised soul, with all its scenery
and history vividly medi&aelig;val. Think of the <i>Spanish
Cloister, The Laboratory, A Grammarian's Funeral</i>, the <i>Bishop
orders his Tomb at Saint Praxed's Church</i>, poems, each of which
paints an historical period or a vivid piece of its life. Think of
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>, with all the world of Rome painted to
the life, and all the soul of the time!</p>
<p>The same kind of work was done for phases and periods of the
arts from Greek times to the Renaissance, I may even say, from the
Renaissance to the present day. <i>Balaustion's Prologue</i>
concentrates the passage of dramatic poetry from Sophocles to
Euripides. <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> realises the wild licence
in which art and freedom died in Athens&mdash;their greatness in
their ruin&mdash;and the passionate sorrow of those who loved what
had been so beautiful. <i>Cleon</i> takes us into a later time when
men had ceased to be original, and life and art had become darkened
by the pain of the soul. We pass on to two different periods of the
Renais<a name='Page21' id="Page21"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>21</span>sance in <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i> and in <i>Andrea
del Sarto</i>, and are carried further through the centuries of art
when we read <i>Abt Vogler</i> and <i>A Toccata of Galuppi's</i>.
Each of these poems is a concentrated, accurate piece of
art-history, with the addition to it of the human soul.</p>
<p>Periods and phases of religious history are equally realised.
<i>Caliban upon Setebos</i> begins the record&mdash;that
philosophic savage who makes his God out of himself. Then follows
study after study, from <i>A Death in the Desert</i> to <i>Bishop
Blougram's Apology</i>. Some carry us from early Christianity
through the medi&aelig;val faith; others lead us through the
Paganism of the Renaissance and strange shows of Judaism to
Browning's own conception of religion in the present day contrasted
with those of the popular religion in <i>Christmas-Day and
Easter-Day</i>.</p>
<p>Never, in poetry, was the desire of the historical critic for
accuracy of fact and portraiture, combined with vivid presentation
of life, so fully satisfied. No wonder Browning was not read of
old; but it is no wonder, when the new History was made, when he
was once found out, that he passed from a few to a multitude of
readers.</p>
<p>6. Another contrast appears at the very beginning of their
career. Tennyson, in his two earliest books in 1830 and 1833,
though clearly original in some poems, had clinging round his
singing robes some of the rags of the past. He wrote partly in the
weak and sentimental strain of the poets between 1822 and 1832.
Browning, on the contrary, sprang at once into an original poetic
life of his own. <i>Pauline</i> was unfinished, irregular in form,
harsh, abrupt, and overloaded, but it was <a name='Page22' id=
"Page22"></a><span class='pagenum'>22</span>also entirely fresh and
distinct. The influence of Shelley echoes in it, but much more in
admiration than in imitation of him. The matter, the spirit of the
poem were his own, and the verse-movement was his own. Had Browning
been an imitator, the first thing he would have imitated would have
been the sweet and rippling movement of Shelley's melodies. But the
form of his verse, such as it was, arose directly out of his own
nature and was as original as his matter. Tennyson grew into
originality, Browning leaped into it; born, not of other poets, but
of his own will. He begat himself. It had been better for his art,
so far as technical excellence is concerned, had he studied and
imitated at first the previous masters. But he did not; and his
dominant individuality, whole in itself and creating its own
powers, separates him at the very beginning from Tennyson.</p>
<p>7. Tennyson became fully original, but he always admitted, and
sometimes encouraged in himself, a certain vein of conventionality.
He kept the opinions of the past in the matter of caste. He clung
to certain political and social maxims, and could not see beyond
them. He sometimes expressed them as if they were freshly
discovered truths or direct emanations from the Deity of England.
He belonged to a certain type of English society, and he rarely got
out of it in his poetry. He inhabited a certain Park of morals, and
he had no sympathy with any self-ethical life beyond its palings.
What had been, what was proper and recognised, somewhat enslaved in
Tennyson that distinctiveness and freedom of personality which is
of so much importance in poetry, and <a name='Page23' id=
"Page23"></a><span class='pagenum'>23</span>which, had it had more
liberty in Tennyson, would have made him a still greater poet than
he was.</p>
<p>Browning, on the other hand&mdash;much more a person in society
than Tennyson, much more a man of the world, and obeying in society
its social conventions more than Tennyson&mdash;never allowed this
to touch his poems. As the artist, he was quite free from the
opinions, maxims, and class conventions of the past or the present.
His poetry belongs to no special type of society, to no special
nationality, to no separate creed or church, to no settled standard
of social morality. What his own thought and emotion urged him to
say, he said with an absolute carelessness of what the world would
say. And in this freedom he preceded and prophesied the reaction of
the last years of the nineteenth century against the tyranny of
maxims and conventions in society, in morals, and in religion. That
reaction has in many ways been carried beyond the proper limits of
what is just and beautiful. But these excesses had to be, and the
world is beginning to avoid them. What remains is the blessing of
life set free, not altogether from the use of conventions, but from
their tyranny and oppression, and lifted to a higher level, where
the test of what is right and fitting in act, and just in thought,
is not the opinion of society, but that Law of Love which gives us
full liberty to develop our own nature and lead our own life in the
way we think best independent of all conventions, provided we do
not injure the life of others, or violate any of the great moral
and spiritual truths by obedience to which the progress of mankind
is promoted and secured. Into that high and free region of thought
<a name='Page24' id="Page24"></a><span class='pagenum'>24</span>and
action Browning brought us long ago. Tennyson did not, save at
intervals when the poet over-rode the man. This differentiates the
men. But it also tells us why Browning was not read fifty years
ago, when social conventions were tyrannous and respectability a
despot, and why he has been read for the last fifteen years and is
read now.</p>
<p>8. There is another contrast between these poets. It is quite
clear that Tennyson was a distinctively English poet and a
patriotic poet; at times too much of a patriot to judge tolerantly,
or to write fairly, about other countries. He had, at least, a
touch of national contempts, even of national hatreds. His position
towards France was much that of the British sailor of Nelson's
time. His position towards Ireland was that of the bishop, who has
been a schoolmaster, to the naughty curate who has a will of his
own. His position towards Scotland was that of one who was aware
that it had a geographical existence, and that a regiment in the
English army which had a genius for fighting was drawn from its
Highlands. He condescends to write a poem at Edinburgh, but then
Edinburgh was of English origin and name. Even with that help he
cannot be patient of the place. The poem is a recollection of an
Italian journey, and he forgets in memories of the
South&mdash;though surely Edinburgh might have awakened some
romantic associations&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>the clouded Forth,</p>
<p>The gloom which saddens Heaven and Earth,</p>
<p class='i2'>The bitter East, the misty summer</p>
<p>And gray metropolis of the North.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Edinburgh is English in origin, but Tennyson did not feel
England beyond the Border. There the <a name='Page25' id=
"Page25"></a><span class='pagenum'>25</span>Celt intruded, and he
looked askance upon the Celt. The Celtic spirit smiled, and took
its vengeance on him in its own way. It imposed on him, as his
chief subject, a Celtic tale and a Celtic hero; and though he did
his best to de-celticise the story, the vengeance lasts, for the
more he did this the more he injured his work. However, being
always a noble artist, he made a good fight for his insularity, and
the expression of it harmonised with the pride of England in
herself, alike with that which is just and noble in it, and with
that which is neither the one nor the other.</p>
<p>Then, too, his scenery (with some exceptions, and those
invented) was of his own land, and chiefly of the places where he
lived. It was quite excellent, but it was limited. But, within the
limit of England, it was steeped in the love of England; and so
sweet and full is this love, and so lovely are its results in song,
that every Englishman has, for this reason if for no other, a deep
and just affection for Tennyson. Nevertheless, in that point also
his poetry was insular. A fault in the poet, not in the poetry.
Perhaps, from this passionate concentration, the poetry was all the
lovelier.</p>
<p>Again, when Tennyson took a great gest of war as his subject, he
took it exclusively from the history of his own land. No one would
know from his writings that high deeds of sacrifice in battle had
been done by other nations. He knew of them, but he did not care to
write about them. Nor can we trace in his work any care for
national struggles or national life beyond this island&mdash;except
in a few sonnets and short pieces concerning Poland and
Montenegro&mdash;an isolation of interests which cannot <a name=
'Page26' id="Page26"></a><span class='pagenum'>26</span>be imputed
to any other great poet of the first part of the nineteenth
century, excepting Keats, who had no British or foreign interests.
Keats had no country save the country of Beauty.</p>
<p>At all these points Browning differed from Tennyson. He never
displayed a special patriotism. On the contrary, he is more Italian
than English, and he is more quick to see and sympathise with the
national characteristics of Spain or France or Germany, than he is
with those of England. No insular feeling prevented him from being
just to foreigners, or from having a keen pleasure in writing about
them. <i>Strafford</i> is the only play he wrote on an English
subject, and it is rather a study of a character which might find
its place in any aristocracy than of an English character. Even Pym
and Hampden fail to be truly English, and it would have been
difficult for any one but Browning to take their eminent English
elements out of them. <i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Sordello</i> belong
to Germany and Italy, and there are scarcely three poems in the
whole of the seven numbers of the <i>Bells and Pomegranates</i>
which even refer to England. Italy is there, and chiefly Italy. In
<i>De Gustibus</i> he contrasts himself with his friend who loves
England:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Your ghost will walk, you lover of trees,</p>
<p class='i2'>(If our loves remain)</p>
<p class='i2'>In an English lane</p>
<p>By a cornfield-side a-flutter with poppies.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<hr class='short' /></div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>What I love best in all the world</p>
<p>Is a castle, precipice-encurled,</p>
<p>In a gash of the wind-grieved Apennine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Look for me, old fellow of mine, if I get out of the <a name=
'Page27' id="Page27"></a><span class='pagenum'>27</span>grave, in a
seaside house in South Italy," and he describes the place and folk
he loves, and ends:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Open my heart and you will see</p>
<p>Graved inside of it, "Italy."</p>
<p>Such lovers old are I and she:</p>
<p>So it always was, so shall ever be!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is a poem written out of his very heart.</p>
<p>And then, the scenery? It is not of our country at all. It is of
many lands, but, above all, it is vividly Italian. There is no more
minute and subtly-felt description of the scenery of a piece of
village country between the mountains and the sea, with all its
life, than in the poem called <i>The Englishman in Italy</i>. The
very title is an outline of Browning's position in this matter. We
find this English poet in France, in Syria, in Greece, in Spain,
but not in England. We find Rome, Florence, Venice, Mantua, Verona,
and forgotten towns among the Apennines painted with happy love in
verse, but not an English town nor an English village. The flowers,
the hills, the ways of the streams, the talk of the woods, the
doings of the sea and the clouds in tempest and in peace, the
aspects of the sky at noon, at sunrise and sunset, are all foreign,
not English. The one little poem which is of English landscape is
written by him in Italy (in a momentary weariness with his daily
adoration), and under a green impulse. Delightful as it is, he
would not have remained faithful to it for a day. Every one knows
it, but that we may realise how quick he was to remember and to
touch a corner of early Spring in England, on a soft and windy
day&mdash;for all the blossoms are scattered&mdash;I quote it here.
It is well to read his sole contribution <a name='Page28' id=
"Page28"></a><span class='pagenum'>28</span>(except in
<i>Pauline</i> and a few scattered illustrations) to the scenery of
his own country:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i4'>Oh, to be in England</p>
<p class='i4'>Now that April's there,</p>
<p class='i2'>And whoever wakes in England</p>
<p class='i2'>Sees, some morning, unaware,</p>
<p>That the lowest boughs and the brushwood sheaf</p>
<p>Round the elm-tree hole are in tiny leaf,</p>
<p>While the chaffinch sings on the orchard bough</p>
<p class='i6'>In England&mdash;now!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And after April, when May follows,</p>
<p>And the whitethroat builds, and all the swallows!</p>
<p>Hark! where my blossomed pear-tree in the hedge</p>
<p>Leans to the field and scatters on the clover</p>
<p>Blossoms and dewdrops&mdash;at the bent spray's edge&mdash;</p>
<p>That's the wise thrush; he sings each song twice over,</p>
<p>Lest you should think he never could recapture</p>
<p>The first fine careless rapture!</p>
<p>And though the fields look rough with hoary dew,</p>
<p>All will be gay, when noontide wakes anew</p>
<p>The buttercups, the little children's dower;</p>
<p>&mdash;Far brighter than this gaudy melon-flower!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So it runs; but it is only a momentary memory; and he knew, when
he had done it, and to his great comfort, that he was far away from
England. But when Tennyson writes of Italy&mdash;as, for instance,
in <i>Mariana in the South</i>&mdash;how apart he is! How great is
his joy when he gets back to England!</p>
<p>Then, again, when Browning was touched by the impulse to write
about a great deed in war, he does not choose, like Tennyson,
English subjects. The <i>Cavalier Tunes</i> have no importance as
patriot songs. They are mere experiments. The poem, <i>How They
brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix</i>, has twice their
vigour. His most intense war-incident is taken from the history of
the French wars under Napoleon. The most ringing and swiftest poem
of <a name='Page29' id="Page29"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>29</span>personal dash and daring&mdash;and at sea, as if
he was tired of England's mistress-ship of the waves&mdash;a poem
one may set side by side with the fight of <i>The Revenge</i>, is
<i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i>. It is a tale of a Breton sailor saving
the French fleet from the English, with the sailor's mockery of
England embedded in it; and Browning sent the hundred pounds he got
for it to the French, after the siege of Paris.</p>
<p>It was not that he did not honour his country, but that, as an
artist, he loved more the foreign lands; and that in his deepest
life he belonged less to England than to the world of man. The
great deeds of England did not prevent him from feeling, with as
much keenness as Tennyson felt those of England, the great deeds of
France and Italy. National self-sacrifice in critical hours,
splendid courage in love and war, belonged, he thought, to all
peoples. Perhaps he felt, with Tennyson's insularity dominating his
ears, that it was as well to put the other side. I think he might
have done a little more for England. There is only one poem, out of
all his huge production, which recognises the great deeds of our
Empire in war; and this did not come of a life-long feeling, such
as he had for Italy, but from a sudden impulse which arose in him,
as sailing by, he saw Trafalgar and Gibraltar, glorified and
incarnadined by a battle-sunset:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Nobly, nobly Cape Saint Vincent to the North-west died away;</p>

<p>It is a little thing, and when it leaves the sunset it is poor.
And there is twice the fervour of its sunset in the description of
the sunrise at Asolo in <i>Pippa Passes</i>.</p>
<p>Again, there is scarcely a trace in his work of any vital
interest in the changes of thought and feeling in England during
the sixty years of his life, such as appear everywhere in Tennyson.
No one would know from his poetry (at least until the very end of
his life, when he wrote <i>Francis Furini</i>) that the science of
life and its origins had been revolutionised in the midst of his
career, or, save in <i>A Death in the Desert</i>, that the whole
aspect of theology had been altered, or that the democratic
movement had taken so many new forms. He showed to these English
struggles neither attraction nor repulsion. They scarcely existed
for him&mdash;transient elements of the world, merely national, not
universal. Nor did the literature or art of his own country engage
him half so much as the literature and art of Italy. He loved both.
Few were better acquainted with English poetry, or reverenced it
more; but he loved it, not because it was English, but of that
world of imagination which has no special country. He cared also
for English art, but he gave all his personal love to the art of
Italy. Nor does he write, as Tennyson loved to do, of the daily
life of the English farmer, squire, miller and sailor, and of
English sweet-<a name='Page31' id="Page31"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>31</span>hearting, nor of the English park and brook and
village-green and their indwellers, but of the work-girl at Asolo,
and the Spanish monk in his garden, and the Arab riding through the
desert, and of the Duchess and her servant flying through the
mountains of Moldavia, and of the poor painters at Fano and
Florence, and of the threadbare poet at Valladolid, and of the
peasant-girl who fed the Tuscan outlaw, and of the poor grammarian
who died somewhere in Germany (as I think Browning meant it), and
of the Jews at Rome, and of the girl at Pornic with the gold hair
and the peasant's hand, and of a hundred others, none of whom are
English. All his common life, all his love-making, sorrow and joy
among the poor, are outside this country, with perhaps two
exceptions; and neither of these has the English note which sounds
so soft and clear in Tennyson. This is curious enough, and it is
probably one of the reasons why English people for a long time
would have so little to do with him. All the same, he was himself
woven of England even more than of Italy. The English elements in
his character and work are more than the Italian. His intellect was
English, and had the English faults as well as the English
excellences. His optimism was English; his steadfast fighting
quality, his unyielding energy, his directness, his desire to get
to the root of things, were English. His religion was the excellent
English compromise or rather balance of dogma, practice and
spirituality which laymen make for their own life. His bold sense
of personal freedom was English. His constancy to his theories,
whether of faith or art, was English; his roughness of form was
positively early Teutonic.</p>
<p><a name='Page32' id="Page32"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>32</span>Then his wit, his <i>esprit</i>,<a name=
'FNanchor_3_3' id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href=
'#Footnote_3_3'>[3]</a> his capacity for induing he skin and the
soul of other persons at remote times of history; his amazing
inventiveness and the ease of it, at which point he beats Tennyson
out of the field; his play, so high fantastical, with his subjects,
and the way in which the pleasure he took in this play overmastered
his literary self-control; his fantastic games with metre and with
rhyme, his want of reverence for the rules of his art; his general
lawlessness, belong to one side, but to one side only, of the
Celtic nature. But the ardour of the man, the pathos of his passion
and the passion of his pathos, his impulse towards the infinite and
the constant rush he made into its indefinite realms; the special
set of his imagination towards the fulfillment of perfection in
Love; his vision of Nature as in colour, rather than in light and
shade; his love of beauty and the kind of beauty that he loved; his
extraordinary delight in all kinds of art as the passionate shaping
of part of the unapproachable Beauty&mdash;these were all old
Italian.</p>
<p><a name='Page33' id="Page33"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>33</span>Then I do not know whether Browning had any
Jewish blood in his body by descent, but he certainly had Jewish
elements in his intellect, spirit and character. His sense of an
ever-victorious Righteousness at the centre of the universe, whom
one might always trust and be untroubled, was Jewish, but he
carried it forward with the New Testament and made the
Righteousness identical with absolute Love. Yet, even in this, the
Old Testament elements were more plainly seen than is usual among
Christians. The appearance of Christ as all-conquering love in
<i>Easter-Day</i> and the scenery which surrounds him are such as
Ezekiel might have conceived and written. Then his intellectual
subtlety, the metaphysical minuteness of his arguments, his
fondness for parenthesis, the way in which he pursued the absolute
while he loaded it with a host of relatives, and conceived the
universal through a multitude of particulars, the love he had for
remote and unexpected analogies, the craft with which his intellect
persuaded him that he could insert into his poems thoughts,
illustrations, legends, and twisted knots of reasoning which a fine
artistic sense would have omitted, were all as Jewish as the
Talmud. There was also a Jewish quality in his natural description,
in the way he invented diverse phrases to express different aspects
of the same phenomenon, a thing for which the Jews were famous; and
in the way in which he peopled what he described with animal life
of all kinds, another remarkable habit of the Jewish poets.
Moreover, his pleasure in intense colour, in splashes and blots of
scarlet and crimson and deep blue and glowing green; in precious
stones for the sake of their colour&mdash;sapphire, ruby, emerald,
<a name='Page34' id="Page34"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>34</span>chrysolite, pearl, onyx, chalcedony (he does not
care for the diamond); in the flame of gold, in the crimson of
blood, is Jewish. So also is his love of music, of music especially
as bringing us nearest to what is ineffable in God, of music with
human aspiration in its heart and sounding in its phrases. It was
this Jewish element in Browning, in all its many forms, which
caused him to feel with and to write so much about the Jews in his
poetry. The two poems in which he most fully enshrines his view of
human life, as it may be in the thought of God and as it ought to
be conceived by us, are both in the mouth of Jews, of <i>Rabbi Ben
Ezra</i> and <i>Jochanan Hakkadosh</i>. In <i>Filippo
Baldinucci</i> the Jew has the best of the battle; his courtesy,
intelligence and physical power are contrasted with the coarseness,
feeble brains and body of the Christians. In <i>Holy-Cross Day</i>,
the Jew, forced to listen to a Christian sermon, begins with coarse
and angry mockery, but passes into solemn thought and dignified
phrase. No English poet, save perhaps Shakespeare, whose exquisite
sympathy could not leave even Shylock unpitied, has spoken of the
Jew with compassion, knowledge and admiration, till Browning wrote
of him. The Jew lay deep in Browning. He was a complex creature;
and who would understand or rather feel him rightly, must be able
to feel something of the nature of all these races in himself. But
Tennyson was not complex. He was English and only English.</p>
<p>But to return from this digression. Browning does not stand
alone among the poets in the apartness from his own land of which I
have written. Byron is partly with him. Where Byron differs from
<a name='Page35' id="Page35"></a><span class='pagenum'>35</span>him
is, first, in this&mdash;that Byron had no poetic love for any
special country as Browning had for Italy; and, secondly, that his
country was, alas, himself, until at the end, sick of his
self-patriotism, he gave himself to Greece. Keats, on the other
hand, had no country except, as I have said, the country of
Loveliness. Wordsworth, Coleridge and Shelley were not exclusively
English. Shelley belonged partly to Italy, but chiefly to that
future of mankind in which separate nationalities and divided
patriotisms are absorbed. Wordsworth and Coleridge, in their early
days, were patriots of humanity; they actually for a time abjured
their country. Even in his later days Wordsworth's sympathies reach
far beyond England. But none of these were so distinctively English
as Tennyson, and none of them were so outside of England as
Browning. Interesting as it is, the <i>completeness</i> of this
isolation from England was a misfortune, not a strength, in his
poetry.</p>
<p>There is another thing to say in this connection. The expansion
of the interests of the English poets beyond England was due in
Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley, and partly in Byron, to the great
tidal-wave of feeling for man as man, which, rising long before the
French Revolution, was lifted into twice its height and dashed on
the shore of the world with overwhelming volume, by the earthquake
in France of 1789. Special national sentiments were drowned in its
waters. Patriotism was the duty of man, not to any one nation but
to the whole of humanity, conceived of as the only nation.</p>
<p>In 1832 there was little left of that influence in England among
the educated classes, and Tennyson's <a name='Page36' id=
"Page36"></a><span class='pagenum'>36</span>insular patriotism
represented their feeling for many years, and partly represents it
now. But the ideas of the Revolution were at the same time taking a
wiser and more practical form among the English democracy than they
even had at their first outburst in France, and this emerged, on
one side of it, in the idea of internationalism. It grew among the
propertied classes from the greater facilities of travel, from the
wide extension of commercial, and especially of literary,
intercommunication. Literature, even more than commerce, diminishes
the oppositions and increases the amalgamation of nations. On her
lofty plane nations breathe an air in which their quarrels die. The
same idea grew up of itself among the working classes, not only in
England, but in Germany, Italy, France, America. They began, and
have continued, to lose their old belief in distinct and warring
nationalities. To denationalise the nations into one nation
only&mdash;the nation of mankind&mdash;is too vast an idea to grow
quickly, but in all classes, and perhaps most in the working class,
there are an increasing number of thinking men who say to the
varied nations, "We are all one; our interests, duties, rights,
nature and aims are one." And, for my part, I believe that in the
full development of that conception the progress of mankind is most
deeply concerned, and will be best secured.</p>
<p>Now, when all these classes in England, brought to much the same
point by different paths, seek for a poetry which is international
rather than national, and which recognises no special country as
its own, they do not find it in Tennyson, but they do find Browning
writing, and quite naturally, as if he belonged to other peoples as
much as to his own, even more than <a name='Page37' id=
"Page37"></a><span class='pagenum'>37</span>to his own. And they
also find that he had been doing this for many years before their
own international interests had been awakened. That, then,
differentiates him completely from Tennyson, and is another reason
why he was not read in the past but is read in the present.</p>
<p>9. Again, with regard to politics and social questions, Tennyson
made us know what his general politics were, and he has always
pleased or displeased men by his political position. The British
Constitution appears throughout his work seated like Zeus on
Olympus, with all the world awaiting its nod. Then, also, social
problems raise their storm-awakening heads in his poetry: the
Woman's Question; War; Competition; the State of the Poor;
Education; a State without Religion; the Marriage Question; where
Freedom lies; and others. These are brought by Tennyson, though
tentatively, into the palace of poetry and given rooms in it.</p>
<p>At both these points Browning differed from Tennyson. He was not
the politician, not the sociologist, only the poet. No trace of the
British Constitution is to be found in his poetry; no one could
tell from it that he had any social views or politics at all. Sixty
years in close contact with this country and its movements, and not
a line about them!</p>
<p>He records the politics of the place and people of whom or of
which he is for the moment writing, but he takes no side. We know
what they thought at Rome or among the Druses of these matters, but
we do not know what Browning thought. The art-representation, the
<i>Vorstellung</i> of the thing, is all; the personal view of the
poet is nothing. It is the <a name='Page38' id=
"Page38"></a><span class='pagenum'>38</span>same in social matters.
What he says as a poet concerning the ideas which should rule the
temper of the soul and human life in relation to our fellow men may
be applied to our social questions, and usefully; but Browning is
not on that plane. There are no poems directly applied to them.
This means that he kept himself outside the realm of political and
social discussions and in the realm of those high emotions and
ideas out of which imagination in lonely creation draws her work to
light. With steady purpose he refused to make his poetry the
servant of the transient, of the changing elements of the world. He
avoided the contemporary. For this high reserve we and the future
of art will owe him gratitude.</p>
<p>On the contrast between the theology we find in Tennyson and
Browning, and on the contrast between their ethical positions, it
will be wiser not to speak in this introduction. These two
contrasts would lead me too far afield, and they have little or
nothing to do with poetry. Moreover, Browning's theology and
ethics, as they are called, have been discussed at wearying length
for the last ten years, and especially by persons who use his
poetry to illustrate from it their own systems of theology,
philosophy and ethics.</p>
<p>10. I will pass, therefore, to another contrast&mdash;the
contrast between them as Artists.</p>
<p>A great number of persons who write about the poets think, when
they have said the sort of things I have been saying, that they
have said either enough, or the most important things. The things
are, indeed, useful to say; they enable us to realise the poet and
his character, and the elements of <a name='Page39' id=
"Page39"></a><span class='pagenum'>39</span>which his poetry is
made. They place him in a clear relation to his time; they
distinguish him from other poets, and, taken all together, they
throw light upon his work. But they are not half enough, nor are
they the most important. They leave out the essence of the whole
matter; they leave out the poetry. They illuminate the surface of
his poetry, but they do not penetrate into his interpretation, by
means of his special art, and under the influence of high emotion,
of the beautiful and sublime Matter of thought and feeling which
arises out of Nature and Human Nature, the two great subjects of
song; which Matter the poets represent in a form so noble and so
lovely in itself that, when it is received into a heart prepared
for it, it kindles in the receiver a love of beauty and sublimity
similar to that which the poet felt before he formed, and while he
formed, his poem. Such a receiver, reading the poem, makes the
poem, with an individual difference, in himself. And this is the
main thing; the eternal, not the temporary thing.</p>
<p>Almost all I have already discussed with regard to Tennyson and
Browning belongs to the temporary; and the varying judgments which
their public have formed of them, chiefly based on their appeal to
the tendencies of the time, do not at all predict what the final
judgment on these men as poets is likely to be. That will depend,
not on feelings which belong to the temporary elements of the
passing day, but on how far the eternal and unchanging elements of
art appear in their work. The things which fitted the poetry of
Tennyson to the years between 1840 and 1870 have already <a name=
'Page40' id="Page40"></a><span class='pagenum'>40</span>passed
away; the things which, as I have explained, fitted the poetry of
Browning to the tendencies of the years after 1870 will also
disappear, and are already disappearing. Indeed, the excessive
transiency of nearly all the interests of cultivated society during
the last ten years is that in them which most deeply impresses any
man who sits somewhat apart from them. And, at any rate, none of
these merely contemporary elements, which often seem to men the
most important, will count a hundred years hence in the estimate of
the poetry either of Tennyson or Browning. They will be of
historical interest, and no more. Matters in their poetry, now the
subjects of warm discussion among their critics, will be laid aside
as materials for judgment; and justly, for they are of quite
impermanent value.</p>
<p>Whenever, then, we try to judge them as poets, we must do our
best to discharge these temporary things, and consider their poetry
as it will seem a hundred years hence to men who will think
seriously and feel sensitively, even passionately, towards great
and noble Matter of imaginative thought and emotion concerning
human life and the natural world, and towards lovely creation of
such matter into Form. Their judgment will be made apart from the
natural prejudices that arise from contemporary movements. They
will not be wiser in their judgment of their own poets than we are
about ours, but they will be wiser in their judgment of our poets,
because, though they will have their own prejudices, they will not
have ours. Moreover, the long, growing, and incessantly corrected
judgment of those best fitted to feel what is most beautiful in
shaping and <a name='Page41' id="Page41"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>41</span>most enduring in thought and feeling penetrated
and made infinite by imagination, will, by that time, have
separated the permanent from the impermanent in the work of
Browning and Tennyson.</p>
<p>That judgment will partly depend on the answers, slowly, as it
were unconsciously, given by the world to two questions. First, how
far does their poetry represent truly and passionately what is
natural and most widely felt in loving human nature, whether
terrible or joyful, simple or complex, tragic or humorous?
Secondly, how far is the representation beautiful and noble in
form, and true to the laws of their art. That poetry which is
nearest to the most natural, the most universal elements of human
life when they are suffused with love&mdash;in some at least of its
various moods&mdash;and at the same time the most beautiful in
form, is the best. It wins most affection from mankind, for it is
about noble matters of thought which the greater number of men and
women desire to contemplate, and about noble matters of passion
which the greater number love and therefore enjoy. This poetry
lasts from generation to generation, is independent of differences
made by climate, by caste, by nationality, by religion, by
politics, by knowledge, custom, tradition or morals. These
universal, natural elements of human nature are, in all their
infinite variety and striving, beloved by men, of undying interest
in action, and of immortal pleasure in thought. The nearer a poet
is to them, especially to what is lovable, and therefore beautiful
in them, the greater and the more enduring is his work. It follows
that this greater work will also be simple, that is, easy to feel
with <a name='Page42' id="Page42"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>42</span>the heart though it may be difficult to grasp by
the intelligence. Were it not simple in feeling, the general answer
of mankind to the call of love, in all its forms, for sympathy
would be unheard. And if it be simple in feeling, it does not much
matter if the deep waters of its thought are difficult for the
understanding to fathom.</p>
<p>It would be ridiculous to dogmatise on a matter which can only
be fully answered a century hence, but this much is plain. Of these
two poets, taking into consideration the whole of their work,
Tennyson is the closest to human nature in its noble, common and
loving forms, as Browning is the closest to what is complex, subtle
and uncommon in human nature. The representation both of the simple
and of the complex is a good thing, and both poets have their place
and honour. But the representation of the complex is plainly the
more limited in range of influence, and appeals to a special class
of minds rather than to mankind at large. There are some, indeed,
who think that the appeal to the few, to thinkers alone or
high-wrought specialists in various forms of culture, marks out the
greater poet. It is the tendency of literary castes to think that
specialised work is the greatest. "This man," they say, "is our
poet, not the mob's. He stands apart, and his apartness marks his
greatness." These are amusing persons, who practically say, "We
alone understand him, therefore he is great."</p>
<p>Yet a phrase like "apartness makes greatness," when justly
applied to a poet, marks, not his superiority of rank, but his
inferiority. It relegates him at once to a lower place. The
greatest poets are loved by all, and understood by all who think
<a name='Page43' id="Page43"></a><span class='pagenum'>43</span>and
feel naturally. Homer was loved by Pericles and by the
sausage-seller. Vergil was read with joy by M&aelig;cenas and
Augustus, and by the vine-dressers of Mantua. Dante drew after him
the greatest minds in Italy, and yet is sung to-day by the
shepherds and peasants of the hill-villages of Tuscany. Shakespeare
pleases the most selected spirits of the world and the galleries of
the strolling theatres.</p>
<p>And though Tennyson and Browning are far below these mightier
poets, yet when we apply to them this rule, drawn from what we know
to be true of the greatest, Tennyson answers its demand more
closely than Browning. The highest work which poetry can do is to
glorify what is most natural and simple in the whole of loving
human nature, and to show the excelling beauty, not so much of the
stranger and wilder doings of the natural world, but of its
everyday doings and their common changes. In doing these two things
with simplicity, passion and beauty is the finest work of the arts,
the eternal youth, the illimitable material of poetry, and it will
endure while humanity endures in this world, and in that which is
to come. Among all our cultivated love of the uncommon, the remote,
the subtle, the involved, the metaphysical and the
terrible&mdash;the representation of which things has its due
place, even its necessity&mdash;it is well to think of that quiet
truth, and to keep it as a first principle in the judgment of the
arts. Indeed, the recovery of the natural, simple and universal
ways of acting and feeling in men and women who love as the finest
subjects of the arts has always regenerated them whenever, in
<a name='Page44' id="Page44"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>44</span>pursuit of the unnatural, the complicated, the
analytic, and the sensational, they have fallen into decay.</p>
<p>Browning did not like this view, being conscious that his poetry
did not answer its demand. Not only in early but also in later
poems, he pictured his critics stating it, and his picture is
scornful enough. There is an entertaining sketch of Naddo, the
Philistine critic, in the second book of <i>Sordello</i>; and the
view I speak of is expressed by him among a huddle of
criticisms&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Would you have your songs endure?</p>
<p>Build on the human heart!&mdash;why, to be sure</p>
<p>Yours is one sort of heart.&mdash;But I mean theirs,</p>
<p>Ours, every one's, the healthy heart one cares</p>
<p>To build on! Central peace, mother of strength,</p>
<p>That's father of...."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is good fooling, and Naddo is an ass. Nevertheless, though
Naddo makes nonsense of the truth, he was right in the main, and
Browning as well as Sordello suffered when they forgot or ignored
that truth. And, of course, Browning did not forget or ignore it in
more than half his work. Even in <i>Sordello</i> he tells us how he
gave himself up to recording with pity and love the doings of the
universal soul. He strove to paint the whole. It was a bold
ambition. Few have fulfilled it so well. None, since Shakespeare,
have had a wider range. His portraiture of life was so much more
varied than that of Tennyson, so much more extensive and detailed,
that on this side he excels Tennyson; but such portraiture is not
necessarily poetic, and when it is fond of the complex, it is
always in danger of tending to prose. And <a name='Page45' id=
"Page45"></a><span class='pagenum'>45</span>Browning, picturing
human life, deviated too much into the delineation of its more
obscure and complex forms. It was in his nature to do and love this
kind of work; and indeed it has to be done, if human life is to be
painted fully. Only, it is not to be done too much, if one desires
to be always the poet. For the representation of the complex and
obscure is chiefly done by the analysing understanding, and its
work and pleasure in it lures the poet away from art. He loses the
poetic turn of the thing of which he writes, and what he produces
is not better than rhythmical prose. Again and again Browning fell
into that misfortune; and it is a strange problem how a man, who
was in one part of his nature a great poet, could, under the sway
of another, cease to be a poet. At this point his inferiority to
Tennyson as a poet is plain. Tennyson scarcely ever wrote a line
which was not unmistakably poetry, while Browning could write pages
which were unmistakably not poetry.</p>
<p>I do not mean, in saying all this, that Browning did not appeal
to that which is deepest and universal in nature and human nature,
but only that he did not appeal to it as much as Tennyson. Browning
is often simple, lovely and universal. And when he speaks out of
that emotional imagination wherein is the hiding of a poet's power,
and which is the legitimate sovereign of his intellectual work, he
will win and keep the delight and love of the centuries to come. By
work of this type he will be finally judged and finally endure;
and, even now, every one who loves great poetry knows what these
master-poems are. As to the others, the merely subtle, analytic
poems in <a name='Page46' id="Page46"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>46</span>which intellect, not imagination, is supreme,
especially those into which he drifted in his later life when the
ardour of his poetic youth glowed less warmly&mdash;they will
always appeal to a certain class of persons who would like to
persuade themselves that they like poetry but to whom its book is
sealed; and who, in finding out what Browning means, imagine to
their great surprise that they find out that they care for poetry.
What they really care for is their own cleverness in discovering
riddles, and they are as far away from poetry as Sirius is from the
Sun.</p>
<p>There are, however, many true lovers of poetry who are
enthusiastic about these poems. And parts of them deserve this
enthusiasm, for they have been conceived and made in a wild
borderland between analysis and imagination. They occupy a place
apart, a backwater in the noble stream of English poetry, filled
with strange plants; and the final judgment of Browning's rank as
an artist will not depend on them but on the earlier poems, which,
being more "simple, sensuous and passionate," are nearer to the
common love and life of man. When, then, we apply this test, the
difference of rank between him and Tennyson is not great, but it is
plain. Yet comparison, on this point, is difficult. Both drew
mankind. Tennyson is closer to that which is most universal in the
human heart, Browning to the vast variety within it; and men in the
future will find their poetic wants best satisfied by reading the
work of both these poets. Let us say then that in this matter they
are equal. Each has done a different part of that portraiture of
human nature which is the chief work of a poet.</p>
<p><a name='Page47' id="Page47"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>47</span>But this is not the only test we may apply to
these men as poets. The second question which tries the endurance
and greatness of poetic work is this: "How far is any poet's
representation of what is true and loving in itself lovely?" Their
stuff may be equally good. Is their form equally good? Is it as
beautiful as an artist, whose first duty is to be true to beauty as
the shape of love and truth, ought to make it? The judgment of the
future will also be formed on that ground, and inevitably.</p>
<p>What we call form in poetry may be said to consist of, or to
depend on, three things: (1) on a noble style; (2) on a harmonious
composition, varied but at unity; (3) on a clear, sweet melody of
lawful movement in verse. These are not everything in poetry, but
they are the half of its whole. The other half is that the
"matter"&mdash;that is, the deep substance of amalgamated Thought
and Emotion&mdash;should be great, vital and fair. But both halves
are necessary, and when the half which regards form is weak or
unbeautiful, the judgment of the future drops the poems which are
faulty in form out of memory, just as it drops out of its
affections poems which are excellent in form, but of ignoble,
unimpassioned, feeble or thoughtless matter. There was, for
example, a whole set of poets towards the end of the Elizabethan
period who were close and weighty thinkers, whose poetry is full of
intellectual surprises and difficulties, who were capable of
subtlety of expression and even of lovely turns and phantasies of
feeling; whom students read to-day, but whom the poetical world
does not read at all. And the reason is that their style, their
melody, and <a name='Page48' id="Page48"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>48</span>their composition do not match in excellence
their matter. Their stuff is good, their form is bad. The judgment
of the future gives them no high rank. They do not answer well to
the test of which I speak.</p>
<p>I do not mean to apply that analogy altogether, only partly, to
Browning. He rises far above these poets in style, composition and
melody, but he skirts their faults. And if we are asked to compare
him to Tennyson, he is inferior to Tennyson at all these points of
Form.</p>
<p>(1) His composition was rarely sufficiently careful. It was
broken up, overcrowded; minor objects of thought or feeling are
made too remarkable for the whole; there is far too little of
poetical perspective; the variety of the poem does not always grow
out of the subject itself, but out of the external play of
Browning's mind upon things remotely connected with the subject;
too many side-issues are introduced; everything he imagined is cast
upon the canvas, too little is laid aside, so that the poems run to
a length which weakens instead of strengthening the main
impression. A number of the poems have, that is, the faults of a
composer whose fancy runs away with him, who does not ride it as a
master; and in whom therefore, for a time, imagination has gone to
sleep. Moreover, only too often, they have those faults of
composition which naturally belong to a poet when he writes as if
intellect rather than passion were the ultimate umpire of the work
of his art. Of course, there are many exceptions; and the study of
those exceptions, as exceptions, would make an interesting essay.
On the other hand, Tennyson's <a name='Page49' id=
"Page49"></a><span class='pagenum'>49</span>composition was for the
most part excellent, and always careful.</p>
<p>(2) Then as to style. Browning had a style of his own, wholly
devoid of imitation, perfectly individual, and this is one of the
marks of a good artist. It was the outcome of his poetic character,
and represented it. At this point his style is more interesting
than Tennyson's. Tennyson's style was often too much worked, too
consciously subjected to the rules of his art, too worn down to
smoothness of texture. Moreover, the natural surprises of an
unchartered individuality do not sufficiently appear in it
(Tennyson repressed the fantastic), though the whole weight of his
character does magnificently appear. But if Tennyson was too
conscious of his style&mdash;a great misfortune especially in
passionate song&mdash;Browning did not take any deliberate pains
with his style, and that is a greater misfortune. His freedom ran
into undue licence; and he seems to be over-conscious, even proud,
of his fantastical way of writing. His individuality runs riot in
his style. He paid little attention to the well-established rules
of his art, in a revulsion, perhaps, from any imitation of the
great models. He had not enough reverence for his art, and little
for the public. He flung his diction at our heads and said: "This
is myself; take it or leave it."</p>
<p>None of the greater artists of the world have ever done this.
They have not cared for what the world said, but they have cared
for their art. There are certain limits to individual
capriciousness in style, long since laid down, as it were, by
Beauty herself; which, transgressed, lessen, injure or lose beauty;
and Browning continually transgressed those limits.</p>
<p><a name='Page50' id="Page50"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>50</span>Again, clearness is one of the first elements in
style, and on poetry attaining clearness, depends, in great
measure, its enduringness in the future. So far as clearness
carries him, Tennyson's poetry is sure to last. So far as
Browning's obscurity goes, his poetry will not last like
Tennyson's. It is all very well for his students to say that he is
not obscure; he is. Nor is it by any exceptional depth of thought
or by any specially profound analysis of the soul that Browning is
obscure. It is by his style. By that he makes what is easy
difficult. The reader does not get at what he means as he gets at
what Homer, Dante, and Shakespeare mean. Dante and Shakespeare are
often difficult through the depth and difficulty of their matter;
they are not difficult, except Shakespeare when he was learning his
art, by obscurity or carelessness of style. But Browning is
difficult not by his thoughts, but by his expression of them. A
poet has no right to be so indifferent, so careless of clearness in
his art, I might almost say, so lazy. Browning is negligent to a
fault, almost to impertinence. The great poets put the right words
in the right places, and Tennyson is with them in that. Browning
continually puts his words into the wrong places. He leaves out
words necessary for the easy understanding of the passage, and for
no reason except his fancy. He leaves his sentences half-finished
and his meaning half-expressed. He begins a sentence, and having
begun it, three or four thoughts connected with it slide into his
mind, and instead of putting them aside or using them in another
place, he jerks them into the middle of his sentence in a series of
parentheses, and then inserts the end of the original sentence, or
does not insert it at all. <a name='Page51' id=
"Page51"></a><span class='pagenum'>51</span>This is irritating
except to folk who like discovery of the twisted rather than
poetry; and it is quite needless. It is worse than needless, for it
lowers the charm and the dignity of the poetry.</p>
<p>Yet, there is something to say on the other side. It is said,
and with a certain justice, that "the style is the man. Strip his
style away, and where is the man? Where is the real Browning if we
get him to change a way of writing in which he naturally shaped his
thought?" Well, no one would ask him to impose on himself a style
which did not fit his nature. That would be fatal. When he has
sometimes tried to do so, as in a few of the dramas, we scarcely
recognise our poet, and we lose half of his intellectual and poetic
charm. Just as Carlyle when he wrote away from his natural style,
as in the life of Sterling and Schiller, is not the great writer he
is elsewhere, so was it with Browning. Were we savage satirists,
blinded by our savagery, we might then say both of Browning and
Carlyle that half their power lay in their fantastic, rocky style.
We should be quite wrong. Their style was the exact clothing of
their thought. They wrote exactly as they thought; and when they
put their thought into other clothing, when they doctored their
style, they did not represent what they really thought. No sensible
person then would have asked Browning to change his style, but
would have asked him not to exaggerate it into its defects. It is
plain he could have kept it within bounds. He has done so
frequently. But as frequently he has allowed it to leap about as
wildly as a young colt. He should have submitted it to the
<i>man&egrave;ge</i>, and ridden it then where he pleased. A
<a name='Page52' id="Page52"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>52</span>very little trouble on his part, a very little
sacrifice of his unbridled fancifulness, would have spared us a
great deal of unnecessary trouble, and made his poetry better and
more enduring.</p>
<p>Another excuse may be made for his faults of style. It may be
said that in one sense the faults are excellences. When a poet has
to represent excessively subtle phases of thought and feeling, with
a crowd of side-thoughts and side-feelings intruding on them; when
he has to describe the excessive oddities, the curious turns of
human emotion in strange inward conditions or outward circumstances
or when he has to deal with rugged or even savage characters under
the sway of the passions; he cannot, we are told, do it otherwise
than Browning did it, and, instead of being lazy, he used these
quips and cranks of style deliberately.</p>
<p>The excuse has something in it. But, all the same, an artist
should have managed it otherwise. Shakespeare was far more subtle
in thought than Browning, and he had to deal with every kind of
strange circumstance and characters; but his composition and his
style illuminate the characters, order the circumstances, and
render clear, as, for example, in the Sonnets, the subtleties of
his thought. A great artist, by his comprehensive grasp of the main
issue of his work, even in a short lyric or a small picture, and by
his luminous representation of it, suggests, without direct
expression of them, all the strange psychology, and the play of
character in the situations. And such an artist does this excellent
thing by his noble composition, and by his lofty, clear, and
melodious style. The excuse is, then, of some weight, but it
<a name='Page53' id="Page53"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>53</span>does not relieve Browning of the charge. Had he
been a greater artist, he would have been a greater master of the
right way of saying things and a greater pleasurer of the future.
Had he taken more pains with his style, but without losing its
individual elements, he might have had as high a poetic place as
Tennyson in the judgment of posterity.</p>
<p>(3) In one thing more&mdash;in this matter of form&mdash;the
beauty of poetry lies. It is in sweetness of melody and its charm;
in exquisite fitness of its music to its thought and its emotion;
in lawful change of harmony making enchanting variety to the ear;
in the obedience of the melodies to the laws of the different kinds
of poetry; and in the lovely conduct of the harmonies, through all
their changes, to that finished close which throws back its own
beauty on all that has preceded it. This part of the loveliness of
form in poetry, along with composition and style&mdash;for without
these and without noble matter of thought poetry is nothing but
pleasant noise&mdash;secures also the continuous delight of men and
the approving judgment of the future; and in this also Tennyson,
who gave to it the steady work of a lifetime, stands above his
brother-poet. Browning was far too careless of his melody. He
frequently sacrificed it, and needlessly, to his thought. He may
have imagined that he strengthened the thing he thought by breaking
the melody. He did not, he injured it. He injured the melody also
by casting into the middle of it, like stones into a clear water,
rough parenthetic sounds to suit his parenthetic phrases. He breaks
it sometimes into two with violent clanging words, with discords
which he <a name='Page54' id="Page54"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>54</span>does not resolve, but forgets. And in the
pleasure he took in quaint oddities of sound, in jarring tricks
with his metre, in fantastic and difficult arrangements of rhyme,
in scientific displays of double rhymes, he, only too often,
immolates melody on the altar of his own cleverness.</p>
<p>A great many of the poems in which the natural loveliness of
melody is thus sacrificed or maimed will last, on account of the
closely-woven work of the intellect in them, and on account of
their vivid presentation of the travail of the soul; that is, they
will last for qualities which might belong to prose; but they will
not last as poetry. And other poems, in which the melody is only
interrupted here and there, will lose a great deal of the
continuity of pleasure they would have given to man had they been
more careful to obey those laws of fine melody which Tennyson never
disobeys.</p>
<p>It is fortunate that neither of these injuries can be attributed
to the whole of his work; and I am equally far from saying that his
faults of style and composition belong to all his poetry.</p>
<p>There are a number of poems the melody of which is beautiful, in
which, if there are discords, they are resolved into a happy
concord at their close. There are others the melody of which is so
strange, brilliant, and capturing that their sound is never
forgotten. There are others the subtle, minor harmonies of which
belong to and represent remote pathetic phases of human passion,
and they, too, are heard by us in lonely hours of pitiful feeling,
and enchant the ear and heart. And these will endure for the noble
pleasure of man.</p>
<p>There are also poems the style of which is fitted <a name=
'Page55' id="Page55"></a><span class='pagenum'>55</span>most
happily to the subject, like the Letter of Karshish to his Friend,
in which Browning has been so seized by his subject, and yet has so
mastered it, that he has forgotten to intercalate his own fancies;
and in which, if the style is broken, it is broken in full harmony
with the situation, and in obedience to the unity of impression he
desired to make. There are others, like <i>Abt Vogler</i>, in which
the style is extraordinarily noble, clear, and uplifted; and there
are long passages in the more important poems, like
<i>Paracelsus</i>, where the joy and glory of the thought and
passion of Browning inform the verse with dignity, and make its
march stately with solemn and beautiful music. Where the style and
melody are thus fine the composition is also good. The parts, in
their variety, belong to one another and to the unity of the whole.
Style, melody and composition are always in the closest relation.
And this nobleness of composition, style, and melody is chiefly
found in those poems of his which have to do with the great matter
of poetry&mdash;the representation of the universal and simple
passions of human nature with their attendant and necessary
thoughts. And there, in that part of his work, not in that other
part for which he is unduly praised, and which belongs to the
over-subtilised and over-intellectual time in which our
self-conscious culture now is striving to resist its decay, and to
prove that its disease is health, is the lasting power of
Browning.</p>
<p>And then, beyond all these matters of form, there is the poet
himself, alone among his fellows in his unique and individual
power, who has fastened himself into our hearts, added a new world
<a name='Page56' id="Page56"></a><span class='pagenum'>56</span>to
our perceptions, developed our lives and enlarged our interests.
And there are the separate and distinguished excellences of his
work&mdash;the virtues which have no defects, the virtues, too, of
his defects, all the new wonders of his realm&mdash;the many
originalities which have justly earned for him that high and lonely
seat on Parnassus on which his noble Shadow sits to-day,
unchallenged in our time save by that other Shadow with whom, in
reverence and love, we have been perhaps too bold to contrast
him.</p>
<p><a name='Page57' id="Page57"></a><span class=

<div class='footnote'>
<p><a name='Footnote_1_1' id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_1_1'>[1]</a> I state it roughly. The <i>Poems of Two
Brothers</i> appeared in 1826, Tennyson's first single volume in
1830, his second in 1833, his last in 1892. Browning's first poem
was issued in 1833, his last in 1890. <i>Paracelsus</i>, in which
his genius clearly disclosed itself, was published in 1835, while
Tennyson, seven years later, proved his mastership in the two
volumes of 1842.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote'>
<p><a name='Footnote_2_2' id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_2_2'>[2]</a> <i>A Death in the Desert</i> touches on the
doubts which, when it was written, had gathered from historical
criticism round the subject matter of the Gospels, but the
prophetic answer of St. John is not critical. It is Browning's
personal reply to the critics, and is based on his own religious
philosophy. The critical part of the argument is left untouched,
and the answer is given from the poet's plane. It is the same when
in the <i>Parleyings with Certain People</i> Furini is made to
embody Browning's belief in a personal God in contradistinction
with the mere evolutionist. He does not argue the points. He places
one doctrine over against the other and bids the reader choose.
Moreover, he claims his view as his own alone. He seeks to impose
it on no one.</p>
</div>
<div class='footnote'>
<p><a name='Footnote_3_3' id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_3_3'>[3]</a> Much has been said of the humour of
Browning. But it is rather wit than humour which we perceive. The
gentle pathos which belongs to humour, the pitiful turn of the
humourist upon himself, his smile at his own follies and those of
mankind, the half light, like that of evening, in which humour
dwells, are wanting in Browning. It is true he has the charity of
humour, though not its pathetic power. But, all the same, he is too
keen, too brilliant, too fierce at times for a humourist. The light
in which we see the foolish, fantastic, amusing or contemptible
things of life is too bright for humour. He is a Wit&mdash;with
charity&mdash;not a humourist. As for Tennyson, save in his
Lincolnshire poems and <i>Will Waterproof's Soliloquy</i>, he was
strangely devoid either of humour or of wit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3><i>THE TREATMENT OF NATURE</i></h3>
<p>It is a difficult task to explain or analyse the treatment of
Nature by Browning. It is easy enough to point out his remarkable
love of her colour, his vivid painting of brief landscapes, his
minute observation, his flashing way of description, his feeling
for the breadth and freshness of Nature, his love of flowers and
animals, and the way he has of hitting and emphasising the central
point or light of a landscape. This is easy work, but it is not so
easy to capture and define the way in which his soul, when he was
alone, felt with regard to the heavens, and the earth and all that
therein is. Others, like Wordsworth, have stated this plainly:
Browning has nowhere defined his way. What his intellect held the
Natural World to be, in itself; what it meant for man; the relation
in which it stood to God and God to it&mdash;these things are
partly plain. They have their attraction for us. It is always
interesting to know what an imaginative genius thinks about such
matters. But it is only a biographical or a half-scientific
interest. But what we want to discover is how Browning, as a poet,
felt the world of Nature. We have to try and catch the unconscious
attitude of his soul when the <a name='Page58' id=
"Page58"></a><span class='pagenum'>58</span>Universe was at work
around him, and he was for the time its centre&mdash;and this is
the real difficulty.</p>
<p>Sometimes we imagine we have caught and fixed this elusive
thing, but we finally give up the quest. The best we can do is to
try to find the two or three general thoughts, the most frequently
recurring emotions Browning had when Nature at sundry hours and in
diverse manners displayed before him her beauty, splendour and
fire, and seemed to ask his worship; or again, when she stood apart
from him, with the mocking smile she often wears, and whispered in
his ear, "Thou shall pursue me always, but never find my secret,
never grasp my streaming hair." And both these experiences are to
be found in Browning. Nature and he are sometimes at one, and
sometimes at two; but seldom the first, and generally the
second.</p>
<p>The natural world Tennyson describes is for the greater part of
it a reflection of man, or used to heighten man's feeling, or to
illustrate his action, or sentimentalised by memorial associations
of humanity, or, finally, invented as a background for a human
subject, and with a distinct direction towards that subject.
Browning, with a few exceptions, does the exact opposite. His
natural world is not made by our thought, nor does it reflect our
passions. His illustrations, drawn from it, of our actions, break
down at certain points, as if the illustrating material were alien
from our nature. Nature, it is true, he thinks, leads up to man,
and therefore has elements in her which are dim prophecies and
prognostics of us; but she is only connected with us as the road is
with the goal it reaches in the end. She exists independently of
<a name='Page59' id="Page59"></a><span class='pagenum'>59</span>us,
but yet she exists to suggest to us what we may become, to awaken
in us dim longings and desires, to surprise us into confession of
our inadequacy, to startle us with perceptions of an infinitude we
do not possess as yet but may possess; to make us feel our
ignorance, weakness, want of finish; and by partly exhibiting the
variety, knowledge, love, power and finish of God, to urge us
forward in humble pursuit to the infinite in him. The day Browning
climbs Mont Sal&egrave;ve, at the beginning of his poem <i>La
Saisiaz</i>, after a description of his climb in which he notes a
host of minute quaintnesses in rock and flower, and especially
little flares of colour, all of them unsentimentalised, he suddenly
stands on the mountain-top, and is smitten with the glory of the
view. What does he see? Himself in Nature? or Nature herself, like
a living being? Not at all. He sees what he thinks Nature is there
to teach us&mdash;not herself, but what is beyond herself. "I was
stationed," he cries, deliberately making this point, "face to face
with&mdash;Nature?&mdash;rather with Infinitude." We are not in
Nature: a part of God aspiring to the whole is there, but not the
all of God. And Nature shows forth her glory, not to keep us with
herself, but to send us on to her Source, of whom the universe is
but a shred.</p>
<p>The universe of what we call matter in all its forms, which is
the definition of Nature as I speak of it here, is one form to
Browning of the creative joy of God: we are another form of the
same joy. Nor does Browning conceive, as Wordsworth conceived, of
any pre-established harmony between us and the natural world, so
that Humanity and Nature <a name='Page60' id=
"Page60"></a><span class='pagenum'>60</span>can easily converse and
live together; so that we can express our thoughts and emotions in
terms of Nature; or so that Nature can have, as it were, a human
soul. This is not Browning's conception. If he had such a
conception he would frequently use in his descriptions what Ruskin
calls the "pathetic fallacy," the use of which is excessively
common in Tennyson. I can scarcely recall more than a very few
instances of this in all the poetry of Browning. Even where it
seems to occur, where Nature is spoken of in human terms, it does
not really occur. Take this passage from <i>James Lee's
Wife</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, good gigantic smile o' the brown old earth,</p>
<p class='i2'>This autumn morning! How he sets his bones</p>
<p>To bask i' the sun, and thrusts out knees and feet</p>
<p>For the ripple to run over in its mirth;</p>
<p class='i2'>Listening the while, where on the heap of stones</p>
<p>The white breast of the sea-lark twitters sweet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The smile, the mirth, the listening, might be said to impute
humanity to Nature: but the Earth and the Sea are plainly quite
distinct from us. These are great giant creatures who are not
ourselves: Titans who live with one another and not with us; and
the terms of our humanity are used to make us aware of their
separate existence from us, not of their being images only of our
mind.</p>
<p>Another passage will illustrate the same habit of Browning's
mind with nature. He describes, for the purpose of his general
thought, in <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, the course of a stormy
sunset. The clouds, the sun, the night, act like men, and are
written of in terms of humanity. But this is only to explain
matters to us; the mighty creatures themselves <a name='Page61' id=
"Page61"></a><span class='pagenum'>61</span>have nothing to do with
us. They live their own vast, indifferent life; and we see, like
spectators, what they are doing, and do not understand what we see.
The sunset seems to him the last act of an ever-recurring drama, in
which the clouds barricade the Sun against his rest, and he plays
with their opposition like the huge giant he is; till Night, with
her terrific mace, angry with them for preventing the Sun from
repose, repose which will make her Queen of the world, beats them
into ruin. This is the passage:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>For as on edifice of cloud i' the grey and green</p>
<p>Of evening,&mdash;built about some glory of the west,</p>
<p>To barricade the sun's departure,&mdash;manifest,</p>
<p>He plays, pre-eminently gold, gilds vapour, crag and crest</p>
<p>Which bend in rapt suspense above the act and deed</p>
<p>They cluster round and keep their very own, nor heed</p>
<p>The world at watch; while we, breathlessly at the base</p>
<p>O' the castellated bulk, note momently the mace</p>
<p>Of night fall here, fall there, bring change with every
blow,</p>
<p>Alike to sharpened shaft and broadened portico</p>
<p>I' the structure; heights and depths, beneath the leaden
stress</p>
<p>Crumble and melt and mix together, coalesce,</p>
<p>Reform, but sadder still, subdued yet more and more</p>
<p>By every fresh defeat, till wearied eyes need pore</p>
<p>No longer on the dull impoverished decadence</p>
<p>Of all that pomp of pile in towering evidence</p>
<p>So lately.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p><i>Fifine, cvi</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is plain that Browning separates us altogether from the
elemental life of these gigantic beings. And what is true of these
passages is true, with one or two exceptions, of all the natural
descriptions of Browning in which the pathetic fallacy seems to be
used by him. I need not say how extraordinarily apart this method
of his is from that of Tennyson. Then Tennyson, like
Coleridge&mdash;only Tennyson <a name='Page62' id=
"Page62"></a><span class='pagenum'>62</span>is as vague and
wavering in this belief as Coleridge is firm and clear in
it&mdash;sometimes speaks as if Nature did not exist at all apart
from our thought:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Her life the eddying of our living soul&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>a possible, even a probable explanation. But it is not
Browning's view. There is a celebrated passage in <i>Paracelsus</i>
which is quite inconsistent with it. All Nature, from the
beginning, is made to issue forth from the joy God has in making,
in embodying his thought in form; and when one form has been made
and rejoiced in, in making another still more lovely on the
foundation of the last. So, joy after joy, the world was built,
till, in the life of all he has made, God sees his ancient rapture
of movement and power, and feels his delight renewed. I will not
quote it here, but only mark that we and the "eddying of our living
soul" have nothing to do with the making of this Nature. It is not
even the thoughts of God in us. God and Nature are alone, and were
alone together countless years before we were born. But man was the
close of all. Nature was built up, through every stage, that man
might know himself to be its close&mdash;its seal&mdash;but not it.
It is a separate, unhuman form of God. Existing thus apart, it does
a certain work on us, impressing us from without. The God in it
speaks to the God in us. It may sometimes be said to be interested
in us, but not like a man in a man. He even goes so far as to
impute to Nature, but rarely, such an interest in us; but in
reality he rather thinks that we, being Nature's end, have at such
times touched for a moment some of those elements in her which have
come down to <a name='Page63' id="Page63"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>63</span>us&mdash;elements apart from the soul. And
Browning takes care, even when he represents Nature as suddenly at
one with us, to keep up the separateness. The interest spoken of is
not a human interest, nor resembles it. It is like the interest
Ariel takes in Prospero and Miranda&mdash;an elemental interest,
that of a creature whose nature knows its radical difference from
human nature. If Nature sees us in sorrow or in joy, she knows, in
these few passages of Browning's poetry, or seems to know, that we
mourn or rejoice, and if she could feel with us she would; but she
cannot quite do so. Like Ariel, she would be grieved with the grief
of Gonzalo, were her affections human. She has then a wild,
unhuman, unmoral, unspiritual interest in us, like a being who has
an elemental life, but no soul. But sometimes she is made to go
farther, and has the same kind of interest in us which Oberon has
in the loves of Helena and Hermia. When we are loving, and on the
verge of such untroubled joy as Nature has always in her being,
then she seems able, in Browning's poetry, actually to work for us,
and help us into the fulness of our joy. In his poem, <i>By the
Fireside</i>, he tells how he and the woman he loved were brought
to know their love. It is a passage full of his peculiar view of
Nature. The place where the two lovers stay their footsteps on the
hill knows all about them. "It is silent and aware." But it is
apart from them also:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>It has had its scenes, its joys and crimes,</p>
<p>But that is its own affair.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And its silence also is its own. Those who linger there think
that the place longs to speak; its bosom <a name='Page64' id=
"Page64"></a><span class='pagenum'>64</span>seems to heave with all
it knows; but the desire is its own, not ours transferred to it.
But when the two lovers were there, Nature, of her own accord, made
up a spell for them and troubled them into speech:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A moment after, and hands unseen</p>
<p class='i2'>Were hanging the night around us fast;</p>
<p>But we knew that a bar was broken between</p>
<p class='i2'>Life and life: we were mixed at last</p>
<p>In spite of the mortal screen.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The forests had done it; there they stood;</p>
<p class='i2'>We caught for a moment the powers at play:</p>
<p>They had mingled us so, for once and good,</p>
<p class='i2'>Their work was done&mdash;we might go or stay,</p>
<p>They relapsed to their ancient mood.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Not one of the poets of this century would have thought in that
fashion concerning Nature. Only for a second, man happened to be in
harmony with the Powers at play in Nature. They took the two lovers
up for a moment, made them one, and dropped them. "They relapsed to
their ancient mood." The line is a whole lesson in Browning's view
of Nature. But this special interest in us is rare, for we are
seldom in the blessed mood of unselfconscious joy and love. When we
are, on the other hand, self-conscious, or in doubt, or out of
harmony with love and joy, or anxious for the transient things of
the world&mdash;Nature, unsympathetic wholly, mocks and plays with
us like a faun. When Sordello climbs the ravine, thinking of
himself as Apollo, the wood, "proud of its observer," a mocking
phrase, "tried surprises on him, stratagems and games."</p>
<p>Or, our life is too small for her greatness. When <a name=
'Page65' id="Page65"></a><span class='pagenum'>65</span>we are
unworthy our high lineage, noisy or mean, then we</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>quail before a quiet sky</p>
<p>Or sea, too little for their quietude.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is a phrase which might fall in with Wordsworth's theory of
Nature, but this which follows from <i>The Englishman in Italy</i>,
is only Browning's. The man has climbed to the top of Calvano,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i4'>And God's own profound</p>
<p>Was above me, and round me the mountains,</p>
<p class='i4'>And under, the sea,</p>
<p>And within me, my heart to bear witness</p>
<p class='i4'>What was and shall be.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He is worthy of the glorious sight; full of eternal thoughts.
Wordsworth would then have made the soul of Nature sympathise with
his soul. But Browning makes Nature manifest her apartness from the
man. The mountains know nothing of his soul: they amuse themselves
with him; they are even half angry with him for his
intrusion&mdash;a foreigner who dares an entrance into their
untrespassed world. Tennyson could not have thought that way. It is
true the mountains are alive in the poet's thought, but not with
the poet's life: nor does he touch them with his sentiment.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, those mountains, their infinite movement</p>
<p class='i6'>Still moving with you;</p>
<p>For, ever some new head and heart of them</p>
<p class='i6'>Thrusts into view</p>
<p>To observe the intruder; you see it</p>
<p class='i6'>If quickly you turn</p>
<p>And, before they escape you surprise them.</p>
<p class='i4'>They grudge you should learn</p>
<p>How the soft plains they look on, lean over</p>
<p class='i4'>And love (they pretend)&mdash;</p>
<p class='i6'>Cower beneath them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page66' id="Page66"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>66</span>Total apartness from us! Nature mocking,
surprising us; watching us from a distance, even pleased to see us
going to our destruction. We may remember how the hills look grimly
on Childe Roland when he comes to the tower. The very sunset comes
back to see him die:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>before it left,</p>
<p>The dying sunset kindled through a cleft:</p>
<p>The hills, like giants at a hunting, lay,</p>
<p>Chin upon hand, to see the game at bay.&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then, as if they loved to see the death of their quarry, cried,
without one touch of sympathy:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Now stab and end the creature&mdash;to the heft!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And once, so divided from our life is her life, she pities her
own case and refuses our pity. Man cannot help her. The starved,
ignoble country in <i>Childe Roland,</i> one of the finest pieces
of description in Browning, wicked, waste and leprous land, makes
Nature herself sick with peevish wrath. "I cannot help my case,"
she cries. "Nothing but the Judgment's fire can cure the
place."</p>
<p>On the whole, then, for these instances might be supported by
many more, Nature is alive in Browning, but she is not humanised at
all, nor at all at one with us. Tennyson does not make her alive,
but he does humanise her. The other poets of the century do make
her alive, but they harmonise her in one way or another with us.
Browning is distinct from them all in keeping her quite divided
from man.</p>
<p>But then he has observed that Nature is expressed in terms of
man, and he naturally, for this conflicts with his general view,
desires to explain this. He <a name='Page67' id=
"Page67"></a><span class='pagenum'>67</span>does explain it in a
passage in <i>Paracelsus</i>. Man once descried, imprints for
ever</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>His presence on all lifeless things; the winds</p>
<p>Are henceforth voices, wailing or a shout,</p>
<p>A querulous mutter or a quick gay laugh,</p>
<p>Never a senseless gust now man is born.</p>
<p>The herded pines commune and have deep thoughts</p>
<p>A secret they assemble to discuss</p>
<p>When the sun drops behind their trunks which glare</p>
<p>Like grates of hell: the peerless cup afloat</p>
<p>Of the lake-lily is an urn, some nymph</p>
<p>Swims bearing high above her head: no bird</p>
<p>Whistles unseen, but through the gaps above</p>
<p>That let light in upon the gloomy woods,</p>
<p>A shape peeps from the breezy forest-top,</p>
<p>Arch with small puckered mouth and mocking eye.</p>
<p>The morn has enterprise, deep quiet droops</p>
<p>With evening, triumph takes the sunset hour.</p>
<p>Voluptuous transport ripens with the corn</p>
<p>Beneath a warm moon like a happy face:</p>
<p>&mdash;And this to fill us with regard for Man.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He does not say, as the other poets do, that the pines really
commune, or that the morn has enterprise, or that nymphs and satyrs
live in the woods, but that this <i>seems</i> to be, because man,
as the crown of the natural world, throws back his soul and his
soul's life on all the grades of inferior life which preceded him.
It is Browning's contradiction of any one who thinks that the
pathetic fallacy exists in his poetry.</p>
<p>Nature has then a life of her own, her own joys and sorrows, or
rather, only joy. Browning, indeed, with his intensity of
imagination and his ineradicable desire of life, was not the man to
conceive Nature as dead, as having no conscious being of any kind.
He did not impute a personality like ours to Nature, but he saw joy
and rapture and <a name='Page68' id="Page68"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>68</span>play, even love, moving in everything; and
sometimes headded to this delight she has in herself&mdash;and just
because the creature was not human&mdash;a touch of elemental
unmoral malice, a tricksome sportiveness like that of Puck in
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream</i>. The life, then, of Nature had no
relation of its own to our life; but we had some relation to it
because we were conscious that we were its close and its
completion.</p>
<p>It follows from this idea of Browning's that he was capable of
describing Nature as she is, without adding any deceiving mist of
human sentiment to his descriptions; and of describing her as
accurately and as vividly as Tennyson, even more vividly, because
of his extraordinary eye for colour. And Nature, so described, is
of great interest in Browning's poetry.</p>
<p>But, then, in any description of Nature, we desire the entrance
into such description of some human feeling so that it may be a
more complete theme for poetry. Browning does this in a different
way from Tennyson, who gives human feelings and thoughts to Nature,
or steeps it in human memories. Browning catches Nature up into
himself, and the human element is not in Nature but in him, in what
<i>he</i> thinks and feels, in all that Nature, quite apart from
him, awakens in him. Sometimes he even goes so far as to toss
Nature aside altogether, as unworthy to be thought of in comparison
with humanity. That joy in Nature herself, for her own sake, which
was so distinguishing a mark of Wordsworth, Coleridge, Shelley,
Byron and Keats, is rarely, if ever, found in Browning. This places
him apart. What he loved was man; and <a name='Page69' id=
"Page69"></a><span class='pagenum'>69</span>save at those times of
which I have spoken, when he conceives Nature as the life and play
and wrath and fancy of huge elemental powers like gods and
goddesses, he uses her as a background only for human life. She is
of little importance unless man be present, and then she is no more
than the scenery in a drama. Take the first two verses of <i>A
Lovers' Quarrel</i>,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, what a dawn of day!</p>
<p>How the March sun feels like May!</p>
<p class='i2'>All is blue again</p>
<p class='i2'>After last night's rain,</p>
<p>And the South dries the hawthorn-spray.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is well done&mdash;he has liked what he saw. But what is it
all, he thinks; what do I care about it? And he ends the verse:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>Only, my Love's away!</p>
<p>I'd as lief that the blue were grey.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then take the next verse:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Runnels, which rillets swell.</p>
<p>Must be dancing down the dell,</p>
<p class='i2'>With a foaming head</p>
<p class='i2'>On the beryl bed</p>
<p>Paven smooth as a hermit's cell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is excellent description, but it is only scenery for the real
passion in Browning's mind.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>Each with a tale to tell&mdash;</p>
<p>Could my Love but attend as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>By the Fireside</i> illustrates the same point. No
description can be better, more close, more observed, than of the
whole walk over the hill; but it is mere scenery for the lovers.
The real passion lies in their hearts.</p>
<p><a name='Page70' id="Page70"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>70</span>We have then direct description of Nature;
direct description of man sometimes as influenced by Nature;
sometimes Nature used as the scenery of human passion; but no
intermingling of them both. Each is for ever distinct. The only
thing that unites them in idea, and in the end, is that both have
proceeded from the creative joy of God.</p>
<p>Of course this way of thinking permits of the things of Nature
being used to illustrate the doings, thinkings and character of
man; and in none of his poems is such illustration better used than
in <i>Sordello</i>. There is a famous passage, in itself a noble
description of the opulent generativeness of a warm land like
Italy, in which he compares the rich, poetic soul of Sordello to
such a land, and the lovely line in it,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And still more labyrinthine buds the rose,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>holds in its symbolism the whole essence of a great artist's
nature. I quote the passage. It describes Sordello, and it could
not better describe Italy:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Sordello foremost in the regal class</p>
<p>Nature has broadly severed from the mass</p>
<p>Of men, and framed for pleasure, as she frames</p>
<p>Some happy lands, that have luxurious names,</p>
<p>For loose fertility; a footfall there</p>
<p>Suffices to upturn to the warm air</p>
<p>Half-germinating spices; mere decay</p>
<p>Produces richer life; and day by day</p>
<p>New pollen on the lily-petal grows,</p>
<p>And still more labyrinthine buds the rose.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That compares to the character of a whole country the character
of a whole type of humanity. I take another of such comparisons,
and it is as <a name='Page71' id="Page71"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>71</span>minute as this is broad, and done with as great
skill and charm. Sordello is full of poetic fancies, touched and
glimmering with the dew of youth, and he has woven them around the
old castle where he lives. Browning compares the young man's
imaginative play to the airy and audacious labour of the spider.
He, that is, Sordello,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>O'er-festooning every interval,</p>
<p>As the adventurous spider, making light</p>
<p>Of distance, shoots her threads from depth to height,</p>
<p>From barbican to battlement: so flung</p>
<p>Fantasies forth and in their centre swung</p>
<p>Our architect,&mdash;the breezy morning fresh</p>
<p>Above, and merry,&mdash;all his waving mesh</p>
<p>Laughing with lucid dew-drops rainbow-edged.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It could not be better done. The description might stand alone,
but better than it is the image it gives of the joy, fancifulness
and creativeness of a young poet, making his web of thoughts and
imaginations, swinging in their centre like the spider; all of them
subtle as the spider's threads, obeying every passing wind of
impulse, and gemmed with the dew and sunlight of youth.</p>
<p>Again, in <i>A Bean-stripe: also Apple-Eating</i>, Ferishtah is
asked&mdash;Is life a good or bad thing, white or black? "Good,"
says Ferishtah, "if one keeps moving. I only move. When I stop, I
may stop in a black place or a white. But everything around me is
motionless as regards me, and is nothing more than stuff which
tests my power of throwing light and colour on them as I move. It
is I who make life good or bad, black or white. I am like the moon
going through vapour"&mdash;and this is the illustration:</p>
<a name='Page72' id="Page72"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>72</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Mark the flying orb</p>
<p>Think'st thou the halo, painted still afresh</p>
<p>At each new cloud-fleece pierced and passaged through</p>
<p>This was and is and will be evermore</p>
<p>Coloured in permanence? The glory swims</p>
<p>Girdling the glory-giver, swallowed straight</p>
<p>By night's abysmal gloom, unglorified</p>
<p>Behind as erst before the advancer: gloom?</p>
<p>Faced by the onward-faring, see, succeeds</p>
<p>From the abandoned heaven a next surprise.</p>
<p>And where's the gloom now?&mdash;silver-smitten straight,</p>
<p>One glow and variegation! So, with me,</p>
<p>Who move and make,&mdash;myself,&mdash;the black, the white.</p>
<p>The good, the bad, of life's environment.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Fine as these illustrations are, intimate and minute, they are
only a few out of a multitude of those comparisons which in
Browning image what is in man from that which is within
Nature&mdash;hints, prognostics, prophecies, as he would call them,
of humanity, but not human.</p>
<p>There is, however, one human passion which Browning conceives as
existing in Nature&mdash;the passion of joy. But it is a different
joy from ours. It is not dashed by any sorrow, and it is very
rarely that we are so freed from pain or from self-contemplation as
to be able to enter even for a brief hour into the rapture of
Nature. That rapture, in Browning's thought, was derived from the
creative thought of God exercising itself with delight in the
incessant making of Nature. And its manifestation was life, that
joyful rush of life in all things into fuller and fuller being. No
poet felt this ecstasy of mere living in Nature more deeply than
Browning. His own rapture (the word is not too strong) in it
appears again and again in his poetry, and when it does, Browning
is not a man sympathising from <a name='Page73' id=
"Page73"></a><span class='pagenum'>73</span>without with Nature. He
is then a part of Nature herself, a living piece of the great
organism, having his own rejoicing life in the mightier life which
includes him; and feeling, with the rest, the abounding pleasure of
continuous life reaching upwards through growth to higher forms of
being, swifter powers of living. I might give many examples, but
one will suffice, and it is the more important because it belongs
not to his ardent youth, but to his mature manhood. It is part of
the song of Thamyris in <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i>. Thamyris,
going to meet the Muses in rivalry, sings as he walks in the
splendid morning the song of the rapture of the life of Earth, and
is himself part of the rejoicing movement.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The next thing to touch on is his drawing of landscape, not now
of separate pieces of Nature, but of the whole view of a land seen
under a certain aspect of the heavens. All the poets ought to be
able to do this well, and I drew attention to the brief, condensed,
yet fan-opening fashion in which Tennyson has done it. Sometimes
the poets describe what they see before them, or have seen; drawing
directly from Nature. Sometimes they invent a wide or varied
landscape as a background for a human subject, and arrange and tone
it for that purpose. Shelley did this with great stateliness and
subtlety. Browning does not do it, except, <a name='Page75' id=
"Page75"></a><span class='pagenum'>75</span>perhaps, in
<i>Christmas-Eve</i>, when he prepares the night for the appearance
of Christ. Nevertheless, even in <i>Christmas-Eve</i>, the
description of the lunar rainbow is of a thing he has seen, of a
not-invented thing, and it is as clear, vivid and natural as it can
be; only it is heightened and thrilled through by the expectancy
and the thrill in Browning's soul which the reader feels and which
the poet, through his emotion, makes the reader comprehend. But
there is no suggestion that any of this feeling exists in Nature.
The rainbow has no consciousness of the vision to come or of the
passion in the poet (as it would have had in Wordsworth), and
therefore is painted with an accuracy undimmed by any transference
to Nature of the soul of the poet.</p>
<p>I quote the piece; it is a noble specimen of his landscape
work:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>But lo, what think you? suddenly</p>
<p>The rain and the wind ceased, and the sky</p>
<p>Received at once the full fruition</p>
<p>Of the moon's consummate apparition.</p>
<p>The black cloud barricade was riven,</p>
<p>Ruined beneath her feet, and driven</p>
<p>Deep in the West; while, bare and breathless,</p>
<p class='i2'>North and South and East lay ready</p>
<p>For a glorious thing that, dauntless, deathless,</p>
<p class='i2'>Sprang across them and stood steady.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'Twas a moon-rainbow, vast and perfect,</p>
<p>From heaven to heaven extending, perfect</p>
<p>As the mother-moon's self, full in face.</p>
<p>It rose, distinctly at the base</p>
<p class='i2'>With its severe proper colours chorded</p>
<p>Which still, in the rising, were compressed,</p>
<p>Until at last they coalesced,</p>
<p class='i2'>And supreme the spectral creature lorded</p>
<a name='Page76' id="Page76"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>76</p>
<p>In a triumph of whitest white,&mdash;</p>
<p>Above which intervened the night.</p>
<p>But above night too, like only the next,</p>
<p class='i2'>The second of a wondrous sequence,</p>
<p class='i2'>Reaching in rare and rarer frequence,</p>
<p>Till the heaven of heavens were circumflexed,</p>
<p>Another rainbow rose, a mightier,</p>
<p>Fainter, flushier and flightier,&mdash;</p>
<p>Rapture dying along its verge.</p>
<p>Oh, whose foot shall I see emerge,</p>
<p>Whose, from the straining topmost dark,</p>
<p>On to the key-stone of that arc?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is only a piece of sky, though I have called it landscape
work. But then the sky is frequently treated alone by Browning; and
is always present in power over his landscapes&mdash;it, and the
winds in it. This is natural enough for one who lived so much in
Italy, where the scenery of the sky is more superb than that of the
earth&mdash;so various, noble and surprising that when Nature plays
there, as a poet, her tragedy and comedy, one scarcely takes the
trouble of considering the earth.</p>
<p>However, we find an abundance of true landscapes in Browning.
They are, with a few exceptions, Italian; and they have that
grandeur and breadth, that intensity given by blazing colour, that
peculiar tint either of labyrinthine or of tragic sentiment which
belong to Italy. I select a few of them:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The morn when first it thunders in March</p>
<p class='i2'>The eel in the pond gives a leap, they say;</p>
<p>As I leaned and looked over the aloed arch</p>
<p class='i2'>Of the villa gate this warm March day,</p>
<p>No flash snapped, no dumb thunder rolled</p>
<p class='i2'>In the valley beneath where, white and wide</p>
<p>Washed by the morning water-gold,</p>
<p class='i2'>Florence lay out on the mountain side</p>
<a name='Page77' id="Page77"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>77</p>
<p>River and bridge and street and square</p>
<p class='i2'>Lay mine, as much at my beck and call,</p>
<p>Through the live translucent bath of air,</p>
<p class='i2'>As the sights in a magic crystal ball.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here is the Roman Campagna and its very sentiment:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The champaign with its endless fleece</p>
<p class='i2'>Of feathery grasses everywhere!</p>
<p>Silence and passion, joy and peace,</p>
<p class='i2'>An everlasting wash of air&mdash;</p>
<p>Rome's ghost since her decease.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And this might be in the same place:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Where the quiet-coloured end of evening smiles,</p>
<p class='i2'>Miles and miles</p>
<p>On the solitary pastures where our sheep</p>
<p class='i2'>Half-asleep</p>
<p>Tinkle homeward through the twilight&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a crimson sunset over dark and distant woods in
autumn:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>That autumn eve was stilled:</p>
<p>A last remains of sunset dimly burned</p>
<p>O'er the far forests, like a torch-flame turned</p>
<p>By the wind back upon its bearer's hand</p>
<p>In one long flare of crimson; as a brand</p>
<p>The woods beneath lay black. A single eye</p>
<p>From all Verona cared for the soft sky.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And if we desire a sunrise, there is the triumphant beginning of
<i>Pippa Passes</i>&mdash;a glorious outburst of light, colour and
splendour, impassioned and rushing, the very upsoaring of Apollo's
head behind his furious steeds. It begins with one word, like a
single stroke on the gong of Nature: it continues till the whole of
the overarching vault, and the world below, in vast disclosure, is
flooded with an ocean of gold.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page78' id="Page78"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>78</p>
<p class='i2'>Day!</p>
<p class='i2'>Faster and more fast,</p>
<p class='i2'>O'er night's brim, day boils at last;</p>
<p class='i2'>Boils, pure gold, o'er the cloud-cup's brim</p>
<p class='i2'>Where spurting and suppressed it lay.</p>
<p class='i2'>For not a froth-flake touched the rim</p>
<p class='i2'>Of yonder gap in the solid gray</p>
<p class='i2'>Of the eastern cloud, an hour away;</p>
<p class='i2'>But forth one wavelet, then another, curled.</p>
<p class='i2'>Till the whole sunrise, not to be suppressed,</p>
<p class='i2'>Rose, reddened, and its seething breast</p>
<p>Flickered in bounds, grew gold, then overflowed the world.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is chiefly of the sky, but the description in that
gipsy-hearted poem, <i>The Flight of the Duchess</i>, brings before
us, at great length, league after league of wide-spreading
landscape. It is, first, of the great wild country, cornfield,
vineyards, sheep-ranges, open chase, till we arrive at last at the
mountains; and climbing up among their pines, dip down into a yet
vaster and wilder country, a red, drear, burnt-up plain, over which
we are carried for miles:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Till at the last, for a bounding belt,</p>
<p>Comes the salt sand hoar of the great sea-shore.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Or we may read the <i>Grammarian's Funeral</i>, where we leave
the city walls and climb the peak on whose topmost ledge he is to
be buried. As we ascend the landscape widens; we see it expanding
in the verse. Moreover, with a wonderful power, Browning makes us
feel the air grow keener, fresher, brighter, more soundless and
lonelier. That, too, is given by the verse; it is a triumph in
Nature-poetry.</p>
<p>Nor is he less effective in narrow landscape, in the description
of small shut-in spaces of <a name='Page79' id=
"Page79"></a><span class='pagenum'>79</span>Nature. There is the
garden at the beginning of <i>Paracelsus</i>; the ravine, step by
step, in <i>Pauline</i>; the sea-beach, and its little cabinet
landscapes, in <i>James Lee's Wife</i>; the exquisite pictures of
the path over the Col di Colma in <i>By the Fireside</i>&mdash;for
though the whole of the landscape is given, yet each verse almost
might stand as a small picture by itself. It is one of Browning's
favourite ways of description, to walk slowly through the
landscape, describing step by step those parts of it which strike
him, and leaving to us to combine the parts into the whole. But
<i>his</i> way of combination is to touch the last thing he
describes with human love, and to throw back this atmosphere of
feeling over all the pictures he has made. The verses I quote do
this.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh moment, one and infinite!</p>
<p class='i2'>The water slips o'er stock and stone;</p>
<p>The West is tender, hardly bright;</p>
<p class='i2'>How grey at once is the evening grown&mdash;</p>
<p>One star, its chrysolite!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>We two stood there with never a third,</p>
<p class='i2'>But each by each, as each knew well:</p>
<p>The sights we saw and the sounds we heard,</p>
<p class='i2'>The lights and the shades made up a spell</p>
<p>Till the trouble grew and stirred.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh, the little more, and how much it is!</p>
<p class='i2'>And the little less, and what worlds away!</p>
<p>How a sound shall quicken content to bliss,</p>
<p class='i2'>Or a breath suspend the blood's best play,</p>
<p>And life be a proof of this!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are many such miniatures of Nature in Browning's poetry.
Sometimes, however, the pictures are larger and nobler, when the
natural thing described is in itself charged with power, terror or
<a name='Page80' id="Page80"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>80</span>dignity. I give one instance of this, where the
fierce Italian thunderstorm is enhanced by being the messenger of
God's vengeance on guilt. It is from <i>Pippa Passes</i>. The
heaven's pillars are over-bowed with heat. The black-blue canopy
descends close on Ottima and Sebald.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Buried in woods we lay, you recollect;</p>
<p>Swift ran the searching tempest overhead;</p>
<p>And ever and anon some bright white shaft</p>
<p>Burned thro' the pine-tree roof, here burned and there,</p>
<p>As if God's messenger thro' the close wood-screen</p>
<p>Plunged and replunged his weapon at a venture,</p>
<p>Feeling for guilty thee and me; then broke</p>
<p>The thunder like a whole sea overhead&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is as splendid as the thing itself.</p>
<p>Again, no one can help observing in all these quotations the
extraordinary love of colour, a love Tennyson has in far fainter
measure, but which Browning seems to possess more than any other
English poet. Only Sir Walter Scott approaches him in this. Scott,
knowing the Highlands, knew dark magnificence of colour. But
Browning's love of colour arose from his having lived so long in
Italy, where the light is so pure, clear, and brilliant that colour
is more intense, and at dawn and sunset more deep, delicate, and
various than it is in our land. Sometimes, as Ruskin says, "it is
not colour, it is conflagration"; but wherever it is, in the bell
of a flower, on the edge of a cloud, on the back of a lizard, on
the veins of a lichen, it strikes in Browning's verse at our eyes,
and he only, in English poetry, has joy enough in it to be its full
interpreter.</p>
<p>He sees the wild tulip blow out its great red <a name='Page81'
id="Page81"></a><span class='pagenum'>81</span>bell; he sees the
thin clear bubble of blood at its tip; he sees the spike of gold
which burns deep in the bluebell's womb; the corals that, like
lamps, disperse thick red flame through the dusk green universe of
the ocean; the lakes which, when the morn breaks,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Blaze like a wyvern flying round the sun;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the woodland brake whose withered fern Dawn feeds with gold; the
moon carried oft at sunrise in purple fire; the larch-blooms crisp
and pink; the sanguine heart of the pomegranate; the filberts
russet-sheathed and velvet-capped; the poppies crimson to
blackness; the red fans of the butterfly falling on the rock like a
drop of fire from a brandished torch; the star-fish, rose-jacynth
to the finger-tips; and a hundred other passionate seizures of
colour. And, for the last of these colour remembrances, in quieter
tints&mdash;almost in black and white&mdash;I quote this lovely
verse from <i>James Lee's Wife</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The swallow has set her six young on the rail,</p>
<p class='i2'>And looks seaward:</p>
<p>The water's in stripes like a snake, olive pale</p>
<p class='i2'>To the leeward,&mdash;</p>
<p>On the weather-side, black, spotted white with the wind.</p>
<p class='i2'>"Good fortune departs, and disaster's
behind"&mdash;</p>
<p>Hark, the wind with its wants and its infinite wail!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, not only do we possess all these landscapes but we possess
them in colour. They are painted as well as drawn. It is his love
of colour which made at least half of the impulse that drove him at
times into Impressionism. Good drawing is little to the
impressionist painters. It is the sudden glow, splash or flicker of
colour that moves them, <a name='Page82' id=
"Page82"></a><span class='pagenum'>82</span>which makes on them the
swift, the momentary impression they wish to record.</p>
<p>And colour acted on Browning in the same way. I said he had been
impressionist, when he liked, for forty years before Impressionism
was born in modern art. He was so, because from the beginning he
saw things in colour, more than in light and shade. It is well
worth a reader's while to search him for colour-impressions. I take
one, for example, with the black horse flung in at the end exactly
in the way an artist would do it who loved a flash of black life
midst of a dead expanse of gold and green:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Fancy the Pampas' sheen!</p>
<p>Miles and miles of gold and green</p>
<p class='i2'>Where the sunflowers blow</p>
<p class='i2'>In a solid glow,</p>
<p>And&mdash;to break now and then the screen&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'>Black neck and eyeballs keen,</p>
<p>Up a wild horse leaps between!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Having, then, this extraordinary power of sight, needing no
carefulness of observation or study, but capable of catching and
holding without trouble all that his eye rested or glanced upon, it
is no wonder that sometimes it amused him to put into verse the
doings of a whole day: the work done in it by men of all classes
and the natural objects that encompassed them; not cataloguing them
dryly, but shooting through them, like rays of light, either his
own fancies and thoughts, or the fancies and thoughts of some
typical character whom he invented. This he has done specially in
two poems: <i>The Englishman in Italy</i>, where the vast shell of
the Sorrento plain, its sea and mountains, and all the doings of
the <a name='Page83' id="Page83"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>83</span>peasantry, are detailed with the most intimate
delight and truth. The second of these poems is <i>Up at a
Villa&mdash;Down in the City</i>, where a farm of the Casentino
with its surroundings is contrasted with the street-life of
Florence; and both are described through the delightful character
whom he invents to see them. These poems are astonishing pieces of
intimate, joyful observation of scenery.</p>
<p>Again, there is no poet whose love of animals is greater than
Browning's, and none who has so frequently, so carefully, so
vividly described them. It is amazing, as we go through his work,
to realise the largeness of his range in this matter, from the
river-horse to the lizard, from the eagle to the wren, from the
loud singing bee to the filmy insect in the sunshine. I give a few
examples. Mortal man could not see a lynx more clearly than
Karshish&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear;</p>
<p>Lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the very soul of the Eagle is in this question&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Ask the geier-eagle why she stoops at once</p>
<p>Into the vast and unexplored abyss,</p>
<p>What full-grown power informs her from the first,</p>
<p>Why she not marvels, strenuously beating</p>
<p>The silent boundless regions of the sky!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He has watched the heavy-winged osprey in its haunts, fain to
fly,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>but forced the earth his couch to make</p>
<p>Far inland, till his friend the tempest wake,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>on whose fiercer wings he can flap his own into activity.</p>
<p>In <i>Caliban upon Setebos</i>, as would naturally be the
<a name='Page84' id="Page84"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>84</span>case, animal life is everywhere; and how close
to truth, how keenly observed it is, how the right points for
description are chosen to make us feel the beast and bird in a
single line; how full of colour, how flashed into words which seem
like colours, the descriptions are, any animal-lover may hear in
the few lines I quote:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;</p>
<p>Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,</p>
<p>That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown</p>
<p>He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye.</p>
<p>By moonlight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is enough to prove his power. And the animals are seen, not
as a cultured person sees them, but as a savage, with his eyes
untroubled by thoughts, sees them; for Browning, with his curious
self-transmuting power, has put himself into the skin of Caliban.
Then again, in that lovely lyric in <i>Paracelsus</i>,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thus the Mayne glideth,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>the banks and waves are full of all the bird and beast life of a
river. Elsewhere, he sees the falcon spread his wings like a
banner, the stork clapping his bill in the marsh, the coot dipping
his blue breast in the water, the swallow flying to
Venice&mdash;"that stout sea-farer"&mdash;the lark shivering for
joy, and a hundred other birds; and lastly, even the great bird of
the Imagination, the Phoenix, flying home; and in a splendid verse
records the sight:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As the King-bird with ages on his plumes</p>
<p>Travels to die in his ancestral glooms.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Not less wonderful, and more unique in English poetry, is his
painting of insects. He describes the <a name='Page85' id=
"Page85"></a><span class='pagenum'>85</span>hermit-bee, the soft,
small, unfrighted thing, lighting on the dead vine-leaf, and
twirling and filing all day. He strikes out the grasshopper at a
touch&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Chirrups the contumacious grasshopper.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He has a swift vision of the azure damsel-fly flittering in the
wood:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Child of the simmering quiet, there to die.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He sees all the insect population of an old green wall; fancies
the fancies of the crickets and the flies, and the carousing of the
cicala in the trees, and the bee swinging in the chalice of the
campanula, and the wasps pricking the papers round the peaches, and
the gnats and early moths craving their food from God when dawn
awakes them, and the fireflies crawling like lamps through the
moss, and the spider, sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back,
and building his web on the edge of tombs. These are but a few
things out of this treasure-house of animal observation and love.
It is a love which animates and populates with life his
landscapes.</p>
<p>Many of the points I have attempted here to make are illustrated
in <i>Saul</i>. In verse v. the sheep are pictured, with all a
shepherd's delightful affection, coming back at evening to the
folding; and, with David's poetic imagination, compared to the
stars following one another into the meadows of night&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And now one after one seeks his lodging, as star follows
star</p>
<p>Into eve and the blue far above us,&mdash;so blue and so
far!&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In verse vi. the quails, and the crickets, and the <a name=
'Page86' id="Page86"></a><span class='pagenum'>86</span>jerboa at
the door of his sand house, are thrilled into quicker life by
David's music. In verse ix. the full joy of living in beasts and
men is painted in the midst of landscape after landscape, struck
out in single lines,&mdash;till all nature seems crowded and
simmering with the intense life whose rapture Browning loved so
well. These fully reveal his poetic communion with animals. Then,
there is a fine passage in verse x. where he describes the
loosening of a thick bed of snow from the mountain-side<a name=
'FNanchor_4_4' id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href=
'#Footnote_4_4'>[4]</a>&mdash;an occurrence which also drew the
interest on Shelley in the <i>Prometheus</i>&mdash;which
illustrates what I have said of Browning's conception of the
separate life, as of giant Titans, of the vaster things in Nature.
The mountain is alive and lives his life with his own grim joy, and
wears his snow like a breastplate, and discharges it when it
pleases him. It is only David who thinks that the great creature
lives to guard us from the tempests. And Hebron, high on its
crested hill, lifts itself out of the morning mist in the same
giant fashion,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>For I wake in the grey dewy covert, while Hebron upheaves</p>
<p>The dawn struggling with night on his shoulder, and Kidron
retrieves</p>
<p>Slow the damage of yesterday's sunshine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then, at the end of the poem, Browning represents all Nature as
full of emotion, as gathered into a fuller life, by David's
prophecy of the coming of <a name='Page87' id=
"Page87"></a><span class='pagenum'>87</span>immortal Love in Christ
to man. This sympathy of Nature with humanity is so rare a thought
in Browning, and so apart from his view of her, that I think he
felt its strangeness here; so that he has taken some pains to make
us understand that it is not Nature herself who does this, but
David, in his uplifted inspiration, who imputes it to her. If that
is not the case, it is at least interesting to find the poet,
impassioned by his imagination of the situation, driven beyond his
usual view into another land of thought.</p>
<p>There is one more thing to say in closing this chapter.
Browning, unlike Tennyson, did not invent his landscapes. He drew
directly from nature. The landscapes in <i>Pauline</i> and
<i>Sordello</i>, and in the lyrical poems are plainly recollections
of what he has seen and noted in his memory, from the sweep of the
mountainous or oceanic horizon to the lichen on the rock and the
painted shell on the seashore. Even the imaginative landscape of
<i>Childe Roland</i> is a memory, not an invention. I do not say he
would have been incapable of such invented landscape as we find in
<i>Oenone</i> and the <i>Lotos-Eaters</i>, but it was not his way
to do this. However, he does it once; but he takes care to show
that it is not real landscape he is drawing, but landscape in a
picture. In <i>Gerard de Lairesse</i>, one of the poems in
<i>Parleyings with Certain People</i>, he sets himself to rival the
"Walk" in Lairesse's <i>Art of Painting</i>, and he invents as a
background to mythological or historic scenes, five landscapes, of
dawn, morning, and noon, evening and falling night. They may be
compared with the walk in <i>Pauline</i>, and indeed one of them
with <a name='Page88' id="Page88"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>88</span>its deep pool watched over by the trees recalls
his description of a similar pool in <i>Pauline</i>&mdash;a lasting
impression of his youth, for it is again used in <i>Sordello</i>.
These landscapes are some of his most careful natural description.
They begin with the great thunderstorm of dawn in which Prometheus
is seen riveted to his rock and the eagle-hound of Zeus beside him.
Then the morning is described and the awakening of the earth and
Artemis going forth, the huntress-queen and the queen of death;
then noon with Lyda and the Satyr&mdash;that sad story; then
evening charged with the fate of empires; and then the night, and
in it a vast ghost, the ghost of departing glory and beauty. The
descriptions are too long to quote, but far too short to read. I
would that Browning had done more of this excellent work; but that
these were created when he was an old man proves that the fire of
imagination burnt in him to the end. They are full of those keen
picture-words in which he smites into expression the central point
of a landscape. They realise the glory of light, the force,
fierceness, even the quiet of Nature, but they have lost a great
deal of the colour of which once he was so lavish. Nevertheless,
the whole scheme of colour in these pictures, with their figures,
recalls the pictures of Tintoret. They have his <i>furia</i>, his
black, gold, and sombre purple, his white mist and barred clouds
and the thunder-roar in his skies. Nor are Prometheus and Artemis,
and Lyda on her heap of skins in the deep woods, unworthy of the
daring hand of the great Venetian. They seem to stand forth from
his canvas.</p>
<p>The poem closes with a charming lyric, half-sad, half-joyful, in
which he hails the spring, and which <a name='Page89' id=
"Page89"></a><span class='pagenum'>89</span>in itself is full of
his heart when it was close to the hopefulness he drew from natural
beauty. I quote it to close this chapter:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Dance, yellows and whites and reds,</p>
<p>Lead your gay orgy, leaves, stalks, heads</p>
<p>Astir with the wind in the tulip-beds.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>There's sunshine; scarcely a wind at all</p>
<p>Disturbs starved grass and daisies small</p>
<p>On a certain mound by a churchyard wall.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Daisies and grass be my heart's bed-fellows,</p>
<p>On the mound wind spares and sunshine mellows:</p>
<p>Dance you, reds and whites and yellows.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>FOOTNOTES:</p>
<div class='footnote'>
<p><a name='Footnote_4_4' id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_4_4'>[4]</a> David could only have seen this on the
upper slopes of Hermon. But at the time of the poem, when he is the
shepherd-youth, he could scarcely have visited the north of
Palestine. Indeed, he does not seem all his life long to have been
near Hermon. Browning has transferred to David what he himself had
seen in Switzerland.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3><i>THE TREATMENT OF NATURE</i></h3>
<p>In the previous chapter, some of the statements made on Browning
as a poet of Nature were not sufficiently illustrated; and there
are other elements in his natural description which demand
attention. The best way to repair these deficiencies will be to
take chronologically the natural descriptions in his poems and to
comment upon them, leaving out those on which we have already
touched. New points of interest will thus arise; and, moreover,
taking his natural description as it occurs from volume to volume,
we may be able&mdash;within this phase of his poetic
nature&mdash;to place his poetic development in a clearer
light.</p>
<p>I begin, therefore, with <i>Pauline</i>. The descriptions of
nature in that poem are more deliberate, more for their own sake,
than elsewhere in Browning's poetry. The first of them faintly
recalls the manner of Shelley in the <i>Alastor</i>, and I have no
doubt was influenced by him. The two others, and the more finished,
have already escaped from Shelley, and are almost pre-Raphaelite,
as much so as Keats, in their detail. Yet all the three are
original, not imitative. They suggest Shelley and Keats, and no
more, and it is only the manner and not the matter of these
<a name='Page91' id="Page91"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>91</span>poets that they suggest. Browning became
instantly original in this as in other modes of poetry. It was
characteristic of him from the beginning to the end of his career,
to possess within himself his own methods, to draw out of himself
new matter and new shapings.</p>
<p>From one point of view this was full of treasureable matter for
us. It is not often the gods give us so opulent an originality.
From another point of view it was unfortunate. If he had begun by
imitating a little; if he had studied the excellences of his
predecessors more; if he had curbed his individuality sufficiently
to mark, learn and inwardly digest the noble style of others in
natural description, and in all other matters of poetry as well,
his work would have been much better than it is; his original
excellences would have found fitter and finer expression; his
faults would have been enfeebled instead of being developed; his
style would have been more concise on one side, less abrupt on
another, and we should not have been wrongly disturbed by
obscurities of diction and angularities of expression. He would
have reached more continuously the splendid level he often
attained. This is plentifully illustrated by his work on external
nature, but less perhaps than by his work on humanity.</p>
<p>The first natural description he published is in the beginning
of <i>Pauline</i>:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thou wilt remember one warm morn when winter</p>
<p>Crept ag&egrave;d from the earth, and spring's first breath</p>
<p>Blew soft from the moist hills; the blackthorn boughs,</p>
<p>So dark in the bare wood, when glistening</p>
<p>In the sunshine were white with coming buds,</p>
<p>Like the bright side of a sorrow, and the banks</p>
<p>Had violets opening from sleep like eyes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page92' id="Page92"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>92</span>That is fairly good; he describes what he has
seen; but it might have been better. We know what he means, but his
words do not accurately or imaginatively convey this meaning. The
best lines are the first three, but the peculiar note of Shelley
sighs so fully in them that they do not represent Browning. What is
special in them is his peculiar delight not only in the morning
which here he celebrates, but in the spring. It was in his nature,
even in old age, to love with passion the beginnings of things;
dawn, morning, spring and youth, and their quick blood; their
changes, impulses, their unpremeditated rush into fresh experiment.
Unlike Tennyson, who was old when he was old, Browning was young
when he was old. Only once in <i>Asolando</i>, in one poem, can we
trace that he felt winter in his heart. And the lines in
<i>Pauline</i> which I now quote, spoken by a young man who had
dramatised himself into momentary age, are no ill description of
his temper at times when he was really old:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As life wanes, all its care and strife and toil</p>
<p>Seem strangely valueless, while the old trees</p>
<p>Which grew by our youth's home, the waving mass</p>
<p>Of climbing plants heavy with bloom and dew,</p>
<p>The morning swallows with their songs like words.</p>
<p>All these seem clear and only worth our thoughts:</p>
<p>So, aught connected with my early life,</p>
<p>My rude songs or my wild imaginings,</p>
<p>How I look on them&mdash;most distinct amid</p>
<p>The fever and the stir of after years!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next description in <i>Pauline</i> is that in which he
describes&mdash;to illustrate what Shelley was to him&mdash;the
woodland spring which became a mighty river. Shelley, as first
conceived by Browning, seemed to him like a sacred spring:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page93' id="Page93"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>93</p>
<p>Scarce worth a moth's flitting, which long grasses cross,</p>
<p>And one small tree embowers droopingly&mdash;</p>
<p>Joying to see some wandering insect won</p>
<p>To live in its few rushes, or some locust</p>
<p>To pasture on its boughs, or some wild bird</p>
<p>Stoop for its freshness from the trackless air.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>A piece of careful detail, close to nature, but not close
enough; needing to be more detailed or less detailed, but the first
instance in his work of his deliberate use of Nature, not for love
of herself only, (Wordsworth, Coleridge or Byron would have
described the spring in the woods for its own sake), but for
illustration of humanity. It is Shelley&mdash;Shelley in his lonely
withdrawn character, Shelley hidden in the wood of his own
thoughts, and, like a spring in that wood, bubbling upwards into
personal poetry&mdash;of whom Browning is now thinking. The image
is good, but a better poet would have dwelt more on the fountain
and left the insects and birds alone. It is Shelley also of whom he
thinks&mdash;Shelley breaking away from personal poetry to write of
the fates of men, of liberty and love and overthrow of wrong, of
the future of mankind&mdash;when he expands his tree-shaded
fountain into the river and follows it to the sea:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And then should find it but the fountain head,</p>
<p>Long lost, of some great river washing towns</p>
<p>And towers, and seeing old woods which will live</p>
<p>But by its banks untrod of human foot.</p>
<p>Which, when the great sun sinks, lie quivering</p>
<p>In light as some thing lieth half of life</p>
<p>Before God's foot, waiting a wondrous change;</p>
<p>Then girt with rocks which seek to turn or stay</p>
<p>Its course in vain, for it does ever spread</p>
<p>Like a sea's arm as it goes rolling on,</p>
<p>Being the pulse of some great country&mdash;so</p>
<p>Wast thou to me, and art thou to the world!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page94' id="Page94"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>94</span>How good some of that is; how bad it is
elsewhere! How much it needs thought, concentration, and yet how
vivid also and original! And the faults of it, of grammar, of want
of clearness, of irritating parenthesis, of broken threads of
thought, of inability to leave out the needless, are faults of
which Browning never quite cleared his work. I do not think he ever
cared to rid himself of them.</p>
<p>The next description is not an illustration of man by means of
Nature. It is almost the only set description of Nature, without
reference to man, which occurs in the whole of Browning's work. It
is introduced by his declaration (for in this I think he speaks
from himself) of his power of living in the life of all living
things. He does not think of himself as living in the whole Being
of Nature, as Wordsworth or Shelley might have done. There was a
certain matter of factness in him which prevented his belief in any
theory of that kind. But he does transfer himself into the
rejoicing life of the animals and plants, a life which he knows is
akin to his own. And this distinction is true of all his poetry of
Nature. "I can mount with the bird," he says,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Leaping airily his pyramid of leaves</p>
<p>And twisted boughs of some tall mountain tree,</p>
<p>Or like a fish breathe deep the morning air</p>
<p>In the misty sun-warm water.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This introduces the description of a walk of twenty-four hours
through various scenes of natural beauty. It is long and
elaborate&mdash;the scenery he conceives round the home where he
and Pauline are to live. And it is so close, and so much of it is
repeated in other forms in his later <a name='Page95' id=
"Page95"></a><span class='pagenum'>95</span>poetry, that I think it
is drawn direct from Nature; that it is here done of set purpose to
show his hand in natural description. It begins with night, but
soon leaves night for the morning and the noon. Here is a piece of
it:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Morning, the rocks and valleys and old woods.</p>
<p>How the sun brightens in the mist, and here,</p>
<p>Half in the air, like<a name='FNanchor_5_5' id=
"FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href='#Footnote_5_5'>[5]</a> creatures of the
place,</p>
<p>Trusting the elements, living on high boughs</p>
<p>That sway in the wind&mdash;look at the silver spray</p>
<p>Flung from the foam-sheet of the cataract</p>
<p>Amid the broken rocks! Shall we stay here</p>
<p>With the wild hawks? No, ere the hot noon come</p>
<p>Dive we down&mdash;safe! See, this is our new retreat</p>
<p>Walled in with a sloped mound of matted shrubs,</p>
<p>Dark, tangled, old and green, still sloping down</p>
<p>To a small pool whose waters lie asleep,</p>
<p>Amid the trailing boughs turned water-plants:</p>
<p>And tall trees overarch to keep us in,</p>
<p>Breaking the sunbeams into emerald shafts,</p>
<p>And in the dreamy water one small group</p>
<p>Of two or three strange trees are got together</p>
<p>Wondering at all around&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is nerveless work, tentative, talkative, no clear
expression of the whole; and as he tries to expand it further in
lines we may study with interest, for the very failures of genius
are interesting, he becomes even more feeble. Yet the feebleness is
traversed by verses of power, like lightning flashing through a
mist upon the sea. The chief thing to say about this direct,
detailed work is that he got out of its manner as fast as he could.
He never tried it again, but passed on to suggest the landscape by
a few sharp, high-coloured words; choosing out one or two of its
elements and <a name='Page96' id="Page96"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>96</span>flashing them into prominence. The rest was left
to the imagination of the reader.</p>
<p>He is better when he comes forth from the shadowy woodland-pool
into the clear air and open landscape:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Up for the glowing day, leave the old woods!</p>
<p>See, they part like a ruined arch: the sky!</p>
<p>Blue sunny air, where a great cloud floats laden</p>
<p>With light, like a dead whale that white birds pick,</p>
<p>Floating away in the sun in some north sea.</p>
<p>Air, air, fresh life-blood, thin and searching air,</p>
<p>The clear, dear breath of God that loveth us,</p>
<p>Where small birds reel and winds take their delight!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The last three lines are excellent, but nothing could be worse
than the sensational image of the dead whale. It does not fit the
thing he desires to illustrate, and it violates the sentiment of
the scene he is describing, but its strangeness pleased his
imagination, and he put it in without a question. Alas, in after
times, he only too often, both in the poetry of nature and of the
human soul, hurried into his verse illustrations which had no
natural relation to the matter in hand, just because it amused him
to indulge his fancy. The finished artist could not do this; he
would hear, as it were, the false note, and reject it. But
Browning, a natural artist, never became a perfect one.
Nevertheless, as his poetry went on, he reached, by natural power,
splendid description, as indeed I have fully confessed; but, on the
other hand, one is never sure of him. He is never quite
"inevitable."</p>
<p>The attempt at deliberate natural description in <i>Pauline</i>,
of which I have now spoken, is not renewed in <i>Paracelsus</i>. By
the time he wrote that <a name='Page97' id=
"Page97"></a><span class='pagenum'>97</span>poem the movement and
problem of the spirit of man had all but quenched his interest in
natural scenery. Nature is only introduced as a background, almost
a scenic background for the players, who are the passions,
thoughts, and aspirations of the intellectual life of Paracelsus.
It is only at the beginning of Part II. that we touch a
landscape:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Over the waters in the vaporous West</p>
<p>The sun goes down as in a sphere of gold</p>
<p>Behind the arm of the city, which between;</p>
<p>With all the length of domes and minarets,</p>
<p>Athwart the splendour, black and crooked runs</p>
<p>Like a Turk verse along a scimitar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is all; nothing but an introduction. Paracelsus turns in a
moment from the sight, and absorbs himself in himself, just as
Browning was then doing in his own soul. Nearly two thousand lines
are then written before Nature is again touched upon, and then
Festus and Paracelsus are looking at the dawn; and it is worth
saying how in this description Browning's work on Nature has so
greatly improved that one can scarcely believe he is the same poet
who wrote the wavering descriptions of <i>Pauline</i>. This is
close and clear:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Morn must be near.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>FESTUS. Best ope the casement: see,</p>
<p>The night, late strewn with clouds and flying stars,</p>
<p>Is blank and motionless: how peaceful sleep</p>
<p>The tree-tops all together! Like an asp<a name='FNanchor_6_6'
id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href='#Footnote_6_6'>[6]</a></p>
<p>The wind slips whispering from bough to bough.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<a name='Page98' id="Page98"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>98</p>
<p>PARACELSUS. See, morn at length. The heavy darkness seems</p>
<p>Diluted, grey and clear without the stars;</p>
<p>The shrubs bestir and rouse themselves as if</p>
<p>Some snake, that weighed them down all night, let go</p>
<p>His hold; and from the East, fuller and fuller,</p>
<p>Day, like a mighty river, flowing in;</p>
<p>But clouded, wintry, desolate and cold.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is good, clear, and sufficient; and there the description
should end. But Browning, driven by some small demon, adds to it
three lines of mere observant fancy.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Yet see how that broad prickly star-shaped plant,</p>
<p>Half-down in the crevice, spreads its woolly leaves,</p>
<p>All thick and glistening with diamond dew.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>What is that for? To give local colour or reality? It does
neither. It is mere childish artistry. Tennyson could not have done
it. He knew when to stay his hand.<a name='FNanchor_7_7' id=
"FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href='#Footnote_7_7'>[7]</a></p>
<p>The finest piece of natural description in
<i>Paracelsus</i><a name='Page99' id="Page99"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>99</span> is of the coming of Spring. It is full of the
joy of life; it is inspired by a passionate thought, lying behind
it, concerning man. It is still more inspired by his belief that
God himself was eternal joy and filled the universe with rapture.
Nowhere did Browning reach a greater height in his Nature poetry
than in these lines, yet they are more a description, as usual, of
animal life than of the beauty of the earth and sea:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Then all is still; earth is a wintry clod:</p>
<p>But spring-wind, like a dancing psaltress, passes</p>
<p>Over its breast to waken it, rare verdure</p>
<p>Buds tenderly upon rough banks, between</p>
<p>The withered tree-roots and the cracks of frost,</p>
<p>Like a smile striving with a wrinkled face;</p>
<p>The grass grows bright, the boughs are swoln with blooms</p>
<p>Like chrysalids impatient for the air,</p>
<p>The shining dorrs are busy, beetles run</p>
<p>Along the furrows, ants make their ado;</p>
<p>Above, birds fly in merry flocks, the lark</p>
<p>Soars up and up, shivering for very joy;</p>
<p>Afar the ocean sleeps; white fishing-gulls</p>
<p>Flit where the strand is purple with its tribe</p>
<p>Of nested limpets; savage creatures seek</p>
<p>Their loves in wood and plain&mdash;and God renews</p>
<p>His ancient rapture.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Once more, in <i>Paracelsus</i>, there is the lovely lyric about
the flowing of the Mayne. I have driven through that gracious
country of low hill and dale and wide water-meadows, where under
flowered banks only a foot high the slow river winds in gentleness;
and this poem is steeped in the sentiment of the scenery. But, as
before, Browning quickly slides away from the beauty of inanimate
nature into a record of the animals that haunt the stream. He could
not get on long with mountains and rivers <a name='Page100' id=
"Page100"></a><span class='pagenum'>100</span>alone. He must people
them with breathing, feeling things; anything for life!</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thus the Mayne glideth</p>
<p>Where my Love abideth.</p>
<p>Sleep's no softer; it proceeds</p>
<p>On through lawns, on through meads,</p>
<p>On and on, whate'er befall,</p>
<p>Meandering and musical,</p>
<p>Though the niggard pasturage</p>
<p>Bears not on its shaven ledge</p>
<p>Aught but weeds and waving grasses</p>
<p>To view the river as it passes,</p>
<p>Save here and there a scanty patch</p>
<p>Of primroses too faint to catch</p>
<p>A weary bee.</p>
<p class='i12'>And scarce it pushes</p>
<p>Its gentle way through strangling rushes</p>
<p>Where the glossy kingfisher</p>
<p>Flutters when noon-heats are near,</p>
<p>Glad the shelving banks to shun</p>
<p>Red and steaming in the sun,</p>
<p>Where the shrew-mouse with pale throat</p>
<p>Burrows, and the speckled stoat;</p>
<p>Where the quick sandpipers flit</p>
<p>In and out the marl and grit</p>
<p>That seems to breed them, brown as they:</p>
<p>Naught disturbs its quiet way,</p>
<p>Save some lazy stork that springs,</p>
<p>Trailing it with legs and wings,</p>
<p>Whom the shy fox from the hill</p>
<p>Rouses, creep he ne'er so still.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"My heart, they loose my heart, those simple words," cries
Paracelsus, and he was right. They tell of that which to see and
love is better, wiser, than to probe and know all the problems of
knowledge. But that is a truth not understood, not believed. And
few there be who find it. And if Browning had found the secret of
how to live more outside of his understanding than he did, or
having <a name='Page101' id="Page101"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>101</span>found it, had not forgotten it, he would not
perhaps have spoken more wisely for the good of man, but he would
have more continuously written better poetry.</p>
<p>The next poem in which he may be said to touch Nature is
<i>Sordello</i>. <i>Strafford</i> does not count, save for the
charming song of the boat in music and moonlight, which the
children sing. In <i>Sordello</i>, the problem of life, as in
<i>Paracelsus</i>, is still the chief matter, but outward life, as
not in <i>Paracelsus</i>, takes an equal place with inward life.
And naturally, Nature, its changes and beauty, being outward, are
more fully treated than in <i>Paracelsus</i>. But it is never
treated for itself alone. It is made to image or reflect the
sentiment of the man who sees it, or to illustrate a phase of his
passion or his thought. But there is a closer grip upon it than
before, a clearer definition, a greater power of concentrated
expression of it, and especially, a fuller use of colour. Browning
paints Nature now like a Venetian; the very shadows of objects are
in colour. This new power was a kind of revelation to him, and he
frequently uses it with a personal joy in its exercise. Things in
Nature blaze in his poetry now and afterwards in gold, purple, the
crimson of blood, in sunlit green and topaz, in radiant blue, in
dyes of earthquake and eclipse. Then, when he has done his
landscape thus in colour, he adds more; he places in its foreground
one drop, one eye of still more flaming colour, to vivify and
inflame the whole.</p>
<p>The main landscape of <i>Sordello</i> is the plain and the low
pine-clad hills around Mantua; the half-circle of the deep lagoon
which enarms the <a name='Page102' id="Page102"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>102</span>battlemented town; and the river Mincio, seen
by Sordello when he comes out of the forest on the hill, as it
enters and leaves the lagoon, and winds, a silver ribbon, through
the plain. It is the landscape Vergil must have loved. A long
bridge of more than a hundred arches, with towers of defence,
crosses the marsh from the towered gateway of the walls to the
mainland, and in the midst of the lagoon the deep river flows fresh
and clear with a steady swiftness. Scarcely anywhere in North Italy
is the upper sky more pure at dawn and even, and there is no view
now so mystic in its desolation. Over the lagoon, and puffing from
it, the mists, daily encrimsoned by sunrise and sunset, continually
rise and disperse.</p>
<p>The character and the peculiarities of this landscape Browning
has seized and enshrined in verse. But his descriptions are so
arranged as to reflect certain moments of crisis in the soul of
Sordello. He does not describe this striking landscape for its own
sake, but for the sake of his human subject. The lines I quote
below describe noon-day on the lagoon, seen from the golden woods
and black pines; and the vision of the plain, city and river,
suddenly opening out from the wood, symbolises the soul of Sordello
opening out from solitude "into the veritable business of
mankind."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Then wide</p>
<p>Opened the great morass, shot every side</p>
<p>With flashing water through and through; a-shine,</p>
<p>Thick-steaming, all-alive. Whose shape divine</p>
<p>Quivered i' the farthest rainbow-vapour, glanced</p>
<p>Athwart the flying herons? He advanced,</p>
<p>But warily; though Mincio leaped no more,</p>
<p>Each footfall burst up in the marish-floor</p>
<p>A diamond jet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page103' id="Page103"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>103</span>And then he somewhat spoils this excellent
thing by a piece of detail too minute for the largeness of the
impression. But how clear and how full of true sentiment it is; and
how the image of Palma rainbowed in the mist, and of Sordello
seeing her, fills the landscape with youthful passion!</p>
<p>Here is the same view in the morning, when Mincio has come down
in flood and filled the marsh:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Mincio, in its place,</p>
<p>Laughed, a broad water, in next morning's face,</p>
<p>And, where the mists broke up immense and white</p>
<p>I' the steady wind, burned like a spilth of light</p>
<p>Out of the crashing of a million stars.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It were well to compare that brilliant piece of light with the
grey water-sunset at Ferrara in the beginning of Book VI.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>While eve slow sank</p>
<p>Down the near terrace to the farther bank,</p>
<p>And only one spot left from out the night</p>
<p>Glimmered upon the river opposite&mdash;</p>
<p>breadth of watery heaven like a bay,</p>
<p>A sky-like space of water, ray for ray,</p>
<p>And star for star, one richness where they mixed</p>
<p>As this and that wing of an angel, fixed,</p>
<p>Tumultuary splendours folded in</p>
<p>To die.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As usual, Spring enchants him. The second book begins with her
coming, and predicates the coming change in Sordello's soul.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The woods were long austere with snow; at last</p>
<p>Pink leaflets budded on the beech, and fast</p>
<p>Larches, scattered through pine-tree solitudes,</p>
<p>Brightened, as in the slumbrous heart of the woods</p>
<p>Our buried year, a witch, grew young again</p>
<p>To placid incantations, and that stain</p>
<p>About were from her cauldron, green smoke blent</p>
<p>With those black pines.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page104' id="Page104"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>104</span>Nor does he omit in <i>Sordello</i> to recall
two other favourite aspects of nature, long since recorded in
<i>Pauline</i>, the ravine and the woodland spring. Just as Turner
repeated in many pictures of the same place what he had first
observed in it, so Browning recalled in various poems the first
impressions of his youth. He had a curious love for a ravine with
overhanging trees and a thin thread of water, looping itself round
rocks. It occurs in the <i>Fireside</i>, it is taken up in his
later poems, and up such a ravine Sordello climbs among the pines
of Goito:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>He climbed with (June at deep) some close ravine</p>
<p>Mid clatter of its million pebbles sheen,</p>
<p>Over which, singing soft, the runnel slipped</p>
<p>Elate with rains.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then, in <i>Sordello</i>, we come again across the fountain in
the grove he draws in <i>Pauline</i>, now greatly improved in
clearness and word-brightness&mdash;a real vision. Fate has given
him here a fount</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Of pure loquacious pearl, the soft tree-tent</p>
<p>Guards, with its face of reate and sedge, nor fail</p>
<p>The silver globules and gold-sparkling grail</p>
<p>At bottom&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>where the impulse of the water sends up the sand in a
cone&mdash;a solitary loveliness of Nature that Coleridge and
Tennyson have both drawn with a finer pencil than Browning. The
other examples of natural description in <i>Sordello</i>, as well
as those in <i>Balaustion</i> I shall reserve till I speak of those
poems. As to the dramas, they are wholly employed with humanity. In
them man's soul has so overmastered Browning that they are scarcely
diversified half a dozen times by any illustrations derived from
Nature.</p>
<p><a name='Page105' id="Page105"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>105</span>We now come, with <i>The Ring and the Book</i>,
to a clear division in his poetry of Nature. From this time forth
Nature decays in his verse. Man masters it and drives it out. In
<i>The Ring and the Book</i>, huge as it is, Nature rarely
intrudes; the human passion of the matter is so great that it
swallows up all Browning's interest. There is a little forky
flashing description of the entrance to the Val d'Ema in Guido's
first statement. Caponsacchi is too intensely gathered round the
tragedy to use a single illustration from Nature. The only person
who does use illustrations from Nature is the only one who is by
age, by his life, by the apartness of his high place, capable of
sufficient quiet and contemplation to think of Nature at all. This
is the Pope.</p>
<p>He illustrates with great vigour the way in which Guido
destroyed all the home life which clung about him and himself
remained dark and vile, by the burning of a nest-like hut in the
Campagna, with all its vines and ivy and flowers; till nothing
remains but the blackened walls of the malicious tower round which
the hut had been built.</p>
<p>He illustrates the sudden event which, breaking in on
Caponsacchi's life, drew out of him his latent power and his inward
good, by this vigorous description:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As when a thundrous midnight, with black air</p>
<p>That burns, rain-drops that blister, breaks a spell,</p>
<p>Draws out the excessive virtue of some sheathed</p>
<p>Shut unsuspected flower that hoards and hides</p>
<p>Immensity of sweetness.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the last illustration, in which the Pope hopes that Guido's
soul may yet be saved by the <a name='Page106' id=
"Page106"></a><span class='pagenum'>106</span>suddenness of his
death, is one of the finest pieces of natural description in
Browning, and reads like one of his own memories:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I stood at Naples once, a night so dark</p>
<p>I could have scarce conjectured there was earth</p>
<p>Anywhere, sky or sea or world at all:</p>
<p>But the night's black was burst through by a blaze&mdash;</p>
<p>Thunder struck blow on blow, earth groaned and bore,</p>
<p>Through her whole length of mountain visible:</p>
<p>There lay the city thick and plain with spires,</p>
<p>And, like a ghost disshrouded, white the sea.</p>
<p>So may the truth be flashed out by one blow,</p>
<p>And Guido see, one instant, and be saved.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>After <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, poor Nature, as one of
Browning's mistresses, was somewhat neglected for a time, and he
gave himself up to ugly representations of what was odd or twisted
in humanity, to its smaller problems, like that contained in
<i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, to its fantastic impulses, its strange
madnesses, its basenesses, even its commonplace crimes. These
subjects were redeemed by his steady effort to show that underneath
these evil developments of human nature lay immortal good; and that
a wise tolerance, based on this underlying godlikeness in man, was
the true attitude of the soul towards the false and the stupid in
mankind. This had been his attitude from the beginning. It
differentiates him from Tennyson, who did not maintain that view;
and at that point he is a nobler poet than Tennyson.</p>
<p>But he became too much absorbed in the intellectual treatment of
these side-issues in human nature. And I think that he was left
unprotected from this or not held back from it by his having almost
given up Nature in her relation to man as a <a name='Page107' id=
"Page107"></a><span class='pagenum'>107</span>subject for his
poetry. To love that great, solemn and beautiful Creature, who even
when she seems most merciless retains her glory and loveliness,
keeps us from thinking too much on the lower problems of humanity,
on its ignobler movements; holds before us infinite grandeur,
infinite beauty, infinite order, and suggests and confirms within
us eternal aspiration. Those intimations of the ideal and endless
perfectness which are dimmed within us by the meaner aspects of
human life, or by the sordid difficulties of thought which a
sensual and wealth-seeking society present to us, are restored to
us by her quiet, order and beauty. When he wrote <i>Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau, Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i>, and <i>The
Inn Album</i>, Nature had ceased to awaken the poetic passion in
him, and his poetry suffered from the loss. Its interest lies in
the narrow realm of intellectual analysis, not in the large realm
of tragic or joyous passion. He became the dissector of corrupt
bodies, not the creator of living beings.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> there are several
intercalated illustrations from Nature, all of which are
interesting and some beautiful. The sunset over Sainte-Marie and
the lie Noirmoutier, with the birds who sing to the dead, and the
coming of the nightwind and the tide, is as largely wrought as the
description of the mountain rill&mdash;the "infant of mist and
dew," and its voyage to the sea is minute and delicate. There is
also that magnificent description of a sunset which I have already
quoted. It is drawn to illustrate some remote point in the
argument, and is far too magnificent for the thing it illustrates.
Yet how few <a name='Page108' id="Page108"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>108</span>in this long poem, how remote from Browning's
heart, are these touches of Nature.</p>
<p>Again, in <i>The Inn Album</i> there is a description of an
English elm-tree, as an image of a woman who makes marriage life
seem perfect, which is interesting because it is the third, and
only the third, reference to English scenery in the multitude of
Browning's verses. The first is in <i>Pauline</i>, the second in
that poem, "Oh, to be in England," and this is the third. The woman
has never ceased to gaze</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>On the great elm-tree in the open, posed</p>
<p>Placidly full in front, smooth hole, broad branch,</p>
<p>And leafage, one green plenitude of May.</p>
<p class='i12'>... bosomful</p>
<p>Of lights and shades, murmurs and silences,</p>
<p>Sun-warmth, dew-coolness, squirrel, bee, bird,</p>
<p>High, higher, highest, till the blue proclaims</p>
<p>"Leave Earth, there's nothing better till next step</p>
<p>Heavenward!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, save in one line, is not felt or expressed with any of
that passion which makes what a poet says completely right.</p>
<p>Browning could not stay altogether in this condition, in which,
moreover, his humour was also in abeyance; and in his next book,
<i>Pacchiarotto, &amp;c.</i>, he broke away from these morbid
subjects, and, with that recovery, recovered also some of his old
love of Nature. The prologue to that book is poetry; and Nature
(though he only describes an old stone wall in Italy covered with
straying plants) is interwoven with his sorrow and his love. Then,
all through the book, even in its most fantastic humour, Nature is
not altogether neglected for humanity; and the poetry, which
Browning seemed <a name='Page109' id="Page109"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>109</span>to have lost the power to create, has partly
returned to him. That is also the case in <i>La Saisiaz,</i> and I
have already spoken of the peculiar elements of the nature-poetry
in that work. In the <i>Dramatic Idyls</i>, of which he was himself
fond; and in <i>Jocoseria</i>, there is very little natural
description. The subjects did not allow of it, but yet Nature
sometimes glides in, and when she does, thrills the verse into a
higher humanity. In <i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, a book full of
flying charm, Nature has her proper place, and in the lyrics which
close the stories she is not forgotten; but still there is not the
care for her which once ran like a full river of delight through
his landscape of human nature. He loved, indeed, that landscape of
mankind the most, the plains and hills and woods of human life; but
when he watered it with the great river of Nature his best work was
done. Now, as life grew to a close, that river had too much dried
up in his poetry.</p>
<p>It was not that he had not the power to describe Nature if he
cared. But he did not care. I have spoken of the invented
descriptions of morn and noon and sunset in Gerard de Lairesse in
the book which preceded <i>Asolando</i>. They have his trenchant
power, words that beat out the scene like strokes on an anvil, but,
curiously enough, they are quite unsuffused with human feeling; as
if, having once divorced Nature from humanity, he never could bring
them together again. Nor is this a mere theory. The Prologue to
<i>Asolando</i> supports it.</p>
<p>That sorrowful poem, written, it seems, in the year he died
(1889), reveals his position towards Nature when he had lost the
power of youth to pour <a name='Page110' id=
"Page110"></a><span class='pagenum'>110</span>fire on the world. It
is full of his last thinking. "The poet's age is sad," he says. "In
youth his eye lent to everything in the natural world the colours
of his own soul, the rainbow glory of imagination:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And now a flower is just a flower:</p>
<p class='i2'>Man, bird, beast are but beast, bird, man&mdash;</p>
<p>Simply themselves, uncinct by dower</p>
<p class='i2'>Of dyes which, when life's day began,</p>
<p>Round each in glory ran."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Ah! what would you have?" he says. "What is the best: things
draped in colour, as by a lens, or the naked things themselves?
truth ablaze, or falsehood's fancy haze? I choose the first."</p>
<p>It is an old man's effort to make the best of age. For my part,
I do not see that the things are the better for losing the colour
the soul gives them. The things themselves are indifferent. But as
seen by the soul, they are seen in God, and the colour and light
which imagination gives them are themselves divine. Nor is their
colour or light only in our imagination, but in themselves also,
part of the glory and beauty of God. A flower is never only a
flower, or a beast a beast. And so Browning would have said in the
days when he was still a lover of Nature as well as of man, when he
was still a faithful soldier in the army of imagination, a poet
more than a philosopher at play. It is a sad business. He has not
lost his eagerness to advance, to climb beyond the flaming walls,
to find God in his heaven. He has not lost the great hopes with
which he began, nor the ideals he nursed of old. He has not lost
his fighting power, nor his cheerful cry that life is before him in
the fulness of <a name='Page111' id="Page111"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>111</span>the world to come. The <i>R&ecirc;verie</i> and
the <i>Epilogue</i> to <i>Asolando</i> are noble statements of his
courage, faith, and joy. There is nothing sad there, nothing to
make us beat the breast. But there is sadness in this abandonment
of the imaginative glory with which once he clothed the world of
Nature; and he ought to have retained it. He would have done so had
he not forgotten Nature in anatomising man.</p>
<p>However, he goes on with his undying effort to make the best of
things, and though he has lost his rapture in Nature, he has not
lost his main theory of man's life and of the use of the universe.
The end of this <i>Prologue</i> puts it as clearly as it was put in
<i>Paracelsus</i>. Nothing is changed in that.</p>
<p>"At Asolo," he continues, "my Asolo, when I was young, all
natural objects were palpably clothed with fire. They mastered me,
not I them. Terror was in their beauty. I was like Moses before the
Bush that burned. I adored the splendour I saw. Then I was in
danger of being content with it; of mistaking the finite for the
infinite beauty. To be satisfied&mdash;that was the peril. Now I
see the natural world as it is, without the rainbow hues the soul
bestowed upon it. Is that well? In one sense yes.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And now? The lambent flame is&mdash;where?</p>
<p class='i2'>Lost from the naked world: earth, sky,</p>
<p>Hill, vale, tree, flower&mdash;Italia's rare</p>
<p class='i2'>O'er-running beauty crowds the eye&mdash;</p>
<p>But flame?&mdash;The Bush is bare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All is distinct, naked, clear, Nature and nothing else. Have I
lost anything in getting down to fact instead of to fancy? Have I
shut my eyes in <a name='Page112' id="Page112"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>112</span>pain&mdash;pain for disillusion? No&mdash;now I
know that my home is not in Nature; there is no awe and splendour
in her which can keep me with her. Oh, far beyond is the true
splendour, the infinite source of awe and love which transcends
her:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>No, for the purged ear apprehends</p>
<p class='i2'>Earth's import, not the eye late dazed:</p>
<p>The Voice said "Call my works thy friends!</p>
<p class='i2'>At Nature dost thou shrink amazed?</p>
<p>God is it who transcends."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>All Browning is in that way of seeing the matter; but he forgets
that he could see it in the same fashion while he still retained
the imaginative outlook on the world of Nature. And the fact is
that he did do so in <i>Paracelsus</i>, in <i>Easter-Day</i>, in a
host of other poems. There was then no need for him to reduce to
naked fact the glory with which young imagination clothed the
world, in order to realise that God transcended Nature. He had
conceived that truth and believed it long ago. And this
explanation, placed here, only tells us that he had lost his
ancient love of Nature, and it is sorrowful to understand it of
him.</p>
<p>Finally, the main contentions of this chapter, which are drawn
from a chronological view of Browning's treatment of Nature, are
perhaps worth a summary. The first is that, though the love of
Nature was always less in him than his love of human nature, yet
for the first half of his work it was so interwoven with his human
poetry that Nature suggested to him humanity and humanity Nature.
And these two, as subjects for thought and feeling, were each
uplifted and impassioned, illustrated and developed, by this
intercommunion. <a name='Page113' id="Page113"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>113</span>That was a true and high position. Humanity was
first, Nature second in Browning's poetry, but both were linked
together in a noble marriage; and at that time he wrote his best
poetry.</p>
<p>The second thing this chronological treatment of his
Nature-poetry shows, is that his interest in human nature pushed
out his love of Nature, gradually at first, but afterwards more
swiftly, till Nature became almost non-existent in his poetry. With
that his work sank down into intellectual or ethical exercises, in
which poetry decayed.</p>
<p>It shows, thirdly, how the love of Nature, returning, but
returning with diminished power, entered again into his love of
human nature, and renewed the passion of his poetry, its singing,
and its health. But reconciliations of this kind do not bring back
all the ancient affection and happiness. Nature and humanity never
lived together in his poetry in as vital a harmony as before, nor
was the work done on them as good as it was of old. A broken
marriage is not repaired by an apparent condonation. Nature and
humanity, though both now dwelt in him, kept separate rooms. Their
home-life was destroyed. Browning had been drawn away by a Fifine
of humanity. He never succeeded in living happily again with
Elvire; and while our intellectual interest in his work remained,
our poetic interest in it lessened. We read it for mental and
ethical entertainment, not for ideal joy.</p>
<p>No; if poetry is to <i>be</i> perfectly written; if the art is
to be brought to its noblest height; if it is to continue to lift
the hearts of men into the realm where perfection lives; if it is
to glow, an unwearied fire, in the world; the love of Nature must
be justly <a name='Page114' id="Page114"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>114</span>mingled in it with the love of humanity. The
love of humanity must be first, the love of Nature second, but they
must not be divorced. When they are, when the love of Nature forms
the only subject, or when the love of Man forms the only subject,
poetry decays and dies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3><i>BROWNING'S THEORY OF HUMAN LIFE<br />
PAULINE AND PARACELSUS</i></h3>
<p>To isolate Browning's view of Nature, and to leave it behind us,
seemed advisable before speaking of his work as a poet of mankind.
We can now enter freely on that which is most distinctive, most
excellent in his work&mdash;his human poetry; and the first thing
that meets us and in his very first poems, is his special view of
human nature, and of human life, and of the relation of both to
God. It marks his originality that this view was entirely his own.
Ancient thoughts of course are to be found in it, but his
combination of them is original amongst the English poets. It marks
his genius that he wrought out this conception while he was yet so
young. It is partly shaped in <i>Pauline</i>; it is fully set forth
in <i>Paracelsus</i>. And it marks his consistency of mind that he
never changed it. I do not think he ever added to it or developed
it. It satisfied him when he was a youth, and when he was an old
man. We have already seen it clearly expressed in the
<i>Prologue</i> to <i>Asolando</i>.</p>
<p>That theory needs to be outlined, for till it is understood
Browning's poetry cannot be understood <a name='Page116' id=
"Page116"></a><span class='pagenum'>116</span>or loved as fully as
we should desire to love it. It exists in <i>Pauline</i>, but all
its elements are in solution; uncombined, but waiting the electric
flash which will mix them, in due proportions, into a composite
substance, having a lucid form, and capable of being used. That
flash was sent through the confused elements of <i>Pauline</i>, and
the result was <i>Paracelsus</i>.</p>
<p>I will state the theory first, and then, lightly passing through
<i>Pauline</i> and <i>Paracelsus</i>, re-tell it. It is fitting to
apologise for the repetition which this method of treatment will
naturally cause; but, considering that the theory underlies every
drama and poem that he wrote during sixty years, such repetition
does not seem unnecessary. There are many who do not easily grasp
it, or do not grasp it at all, and they may be grateful. As to
those who do understand it, they will be happy in their anger with
any explanation of what they know so well.</p>
<p>He asks what is the secret of the world: "of man and man's true
purpose, path and fate." He proposes to understand "God-and his
works and all God's intercourse with the human soul."</p>
<p>We are here, he thinks, to grow enough to be able to take our
part in another life or lives. But we are surrounded by limitations
which baffle and retard our growth. That is miserable, but not so
much as we think; for the failures these limitations cause prevent
us&mdash;and this is a main point in Browning's view&mdash;from
being content with our condition on the earth. There is that within
us which is always endeavouring to transcend those limitations, and
which believes in their final dispersal. This aspiration rises to
something higher <a name='Page117' id="Page117"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>117</span>than any possible actual on earth. It is never
worn out; it is the divine in us; and when it seems to decay, God
renews it by spiritual influences from without and within, coming
to us from nature as seen by us, from humanity as felt by us, and
from himself who dwells in us.</p>
<p>But then, unless we find out and submit to those limitations,
and work within them, life is useless, so far as any life is
useless. But while we work within them, we see beyond them an
illimitable land, and thirst for it. This battle between the dire
necessity of working in chains and longing for freedom, between the
infinite destiny of the soul and the baffling of its effort to
realise its infinitude on earth, makes the storm and misery of
life. We may try to escape that tempest and sorrow by determining
to think, feel, and act only within our limitations, to be content
with them as Goethe said; but if we do, we are worse off than
before. We have thrown away our divine destiny. If we take this
world and are satisfied with it, cease to aspire, beyond our
limits, to full perfection in God; if our soul should ever say, "I
want no more; what I have here&mdash;the pleasure, fame, knowledge,
beauty or love of this world&mdash;is all I need or care for," then
we are indeed lost. That is the last damnation. The worst failure,
the deepest misery, is better than contentment with the success of
earth; and seen in this light, the failures and misery of earth are
actually good things, the cause of a chastened joy. They open to us
the larger light. They suggest, and in Browning's belief they
proved, that this life is but the threshold of an infinite life,
that our true life is beyond, that there <a name='Page118' id=
"Page118"></a><span class='pagenum'>118</span>is an infinite of
happiness, of knowledge, of love, of beauty which we shall attain.
Our failures are prophecies of eternal successes. To choose the
finite life is to miss the infinite Life! O fool, to claim the
little cup of water earth's knowledge offers to thy thirst, or the
beauty or love of earth, when the immeasurable waters of the
Knowledge, Beauty and Love of the Eternal Paradise are thine beyond
the earth.</p>
<p>Two things are then clear: (1) The attainment of our desires for
perfection, the satisfaction of our passion for the infinite, is
forbidden to us on earth by the limitations of life. We are made
imperfect; we are kept imperfect here; and we must do all our work
within the limits this natural imperfection makes. (2) We must,
nevertheless, not cease to strive towards the perfection
unattainable on earth, but which shall be attained hereafter. Our
destiny, the God within us, demands that. And we lose it, if we are
content with our earthly life, even with its highest things, with
knowledge, beauty, or with love.</p>
<p>Hence, the foundation of Browning's theory is a kind of Original
Sin in us, a natural defectiveness deliberately imposed on us by
God, which prevents us attaining any absolute success on earth. And
this defectiveness of nature is met by the truth, which, while we
aspire, we know&mdash;that God will fulfil all noble desire in a
life to come.</p>
<p>We must aspire then, but at the same time all aspiring is to be
conterminous with steady work within our limits. Aspiration to the
perfect is not to make us idle, indifferent to the present, but to
drive us on. Its passion teaches us, as it urges into action
<a name='Page119' id="Page119"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>119</span>all our powers, what we can and what we cannot
do. That is, it teaches us, through the action it engenders, what
our limits are; and when we know them, the main duties of life rise
clear. The first of these is, to work patiently within our limits;
and the second is the apparent contradiction of the first, never to
be satisfied with our limits, or with the results we attain within
them. Then, having worked within them, but always looked beyond
them, we, as life closes, learn the secret. The failures of earth
prove the victory beyond: "For&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>what is our failure here but a triumph's
evidence</p>
<p class='i2'>For the fulness of the days? Have we withered or
agonised?</p>
<p>Why else was the pause prolonged but that singing might issue
thence?</p>
<p class='i2'>Why rushed the discords in but that harmony should be
prized?</p>
<p>Sorrow is hard to bear, and doubt is slow to clear.</p>
<p class='i2'>Each sufferer says his say, his scheme of the weal
and the woe:</p>
<p>But God has a few of us whom he whispers in the ear;</p>
<p class='i2'>The rest may reason, and welcome: 'tis we musicians
know."</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p><i>Abt Vogler</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Finally, the root and flower of this patient but uncontented
work is Love for man because of his being in God, because of his
high and immortal destiny. All that we do, whether failure or not,
builds up the perfect humanity to come, and flows into the
perfection of God in whom is the perfection of man. This love,
grounded on this faith, brings joy into life; and, in this joy of
love, we enter into the eternal temple of the Life to come. Love
opens Heaven while Earth closes us round. At last limitations cease
to trouble us. <a name='Page120' id="Page120"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>120</span>They are lost in the vision, they bring no more
sorrow, doubt or baffling. Therefore, in this confused chaotic time
on earth&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Earn the means first. God surely will contrive</p>
<p class='i2'>Use for our earning.</p>
<p>Others mistrust, and say: "But time escapes;</p>
<p class='i2'>Live now or never!"</p>
<p>He said, "What's time? Leave Now for dogs and apes!</p>
<p class='i2'>Man has Forever."</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p><i>A Grammarian's Funeral</i>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is a sketch of his explanation of life. The expression of
it began in <i>Pauline</i>. Had that poem been as imitative, as
poor as the first efforts of poets usually are, we might leave it
aside. But though, as he said, "good draughtsmanship and right
handling were far beyond the artist at that time," though "with
repugnance and purely of necessity" he republished it, he did
republish it; and he was right. It was crude and confused, but the
stuff in it was original and poetic; wonderful stuff for a young
man.</p>
<p>The first design of it was huge. <i>Pauline</i> is but a
fragment of a poem which was to represent, not one but various
types of human life. It became only the presentation of the type of
the poet, the first sketch of the youth of Sordello. The other
types conceived were worked up into other poems.</p>
<p>The hero in <i>Pauline</i> hides in his love for Pauline from a
past he longed to forget. He had aspired to the absolute beauty and
goodness, and the end was vanity and vexation. The shame of this
failure beset him from the past, and the failure was caused because
he had not been true to the aspirations which took him beyond
himself. When <a name='Page121' id="Page121"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>121</span>he returned to self, the glory departed. And a
fine simile of his soul as a young witch whose blue eyes,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As she stood naked by the river springs,</p>
<p>Drew down a God,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>who, as he sat in the sunshine on her knees singing of heaven,
saw the mockery in her eyes and vanished, tells of how the early
ravishment departed, slain by self-scorn that followed on
self-worship. But one love and reverence remained&mdash;that for
Shelley, the Sun-treader, and kept him from being "wholly lost." To
strengthen this one self-forgetful element, the love of Pauline
enters in, and the new impulse brings back something of the ancient
joy. "Let me take it," he cries, "and sing on again</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>fast as fancies come;</p>
<p>Rudely, the verse being as the mood it paints,"&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>a line which tells us how Browning wished his metrical movement
to be judged. This is the exordium, and it is already full of his
theory of life&mdash;the soul forced from within to aspire to the
perfect whole, the necessary failure, the despair, the new impulse
to love arising out of the despair; failure making fresh growth,
fresh uncontentment. God has sent a new impulse from without; let
me begin again.</p>
<p>Then, in the new light, he strips his mind bare. What am I? What
have I done? Where am I going?</p>
<p>The first element in his soul, he thinks, is a living
personality, linked to a principle of restlessness,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Which would be all, have, see, know, taste, feel, all.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page122' id="Page122"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>122</span>And this would plunge him into the depths of
self were it not for that Imagination in him whose power never
fails to bear him beyond himself; and is finally in him a need, a
trust, a yearning after God; whom, even when he is most lost, he
feels is always acting on him, and at every point of life
transcending him.</p>
<p>And Imagination began to create, and made him at one with all
men and women of whom he had read (the same motive is repeated in
<i>Sordello</i>), but especially at one with those out of the Greek
world he loved&mdash;"a God wandering after Beauty"&mdash;a
high-crested chief</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Sailing with troops of friends to Tenedos.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Never was anything more clear than these lives he lived beyond
himself; and the lines in which he records the vision have all the
sharpness and beauty of his after-work&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I had not seen a work of lofty art.</p>
<p>Nor woman's beauty nor sweet Nature's face,</p>
<p>Yet, I say, never morn broke clear as those</p>
<p>On the dim-clustered isles in the blue sea,</p>
<p>The deep groves and white temples and wet caves:</p>
<p>And nothing ever will surprise me now&mdash;</p>
<p>Who stood beside the naked Swift-footed,</p>
<p>Who bound my forehead with Proserpine's hair.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, having this infinite world of beauty, he aimed low; lost in
immediate wants, striving only for the mortal and the possible,
while all the time there lived in him, breathing with keen desire,
powers which, developed, would make him at one with the infinite
Life of God.</p>
<p>But having thus been untrue to his early aspiration, he fell
into the sensual life, like Paracelsus, and <a name='Page123' id=
"Page123"></a><span class='pagenum'>123</span>then, remorseful,
sought peace in self-restraint; but no rest, no contentment was
gained that way. It is one of Browning's root-ideas that peace is
not won by repression of the noble passions, but by letting them
loose in full freedom to pursue after their highest aims. Not in
restraint, but in the conscious impetuosity of the soul towards the
divine realities, is the wisdom of life. Many poems are consecrated
to this idea.</p>
<p>So, cleansing his soul by ennobling desire, he sought to realise
his dreams in the arts, in the creation and expression of pure
Beauty. And he followed Poetry and Music and Painting, and chiefly
explored passion and mind in the great poets. Fed at these deep
springs, his soul rose into keen life; his powers burst forth, and
gazing on all systems and schemes of philosophy and government, he
heard ineffable things unguessed by man. All Plato entered into
him; he vowed himself to liberty and the new world where "men were
to be as gods and earth us heaven." Thus, yet here on earth, not
only beyond the earth, he would attain the Perfect. Man also shall
attain it; and so thinking, he turned, like Sordello, to look at
and learn mankind, pondering "how best life's end might be
attained&mdash;an end comprising every joy."</p>
<p>And even as he believed, the glory vanished; everything he had
hoped for broke to pieces:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>First went my hopes of perfecting mankind,</p>
<p>Next&mdash;faith in them, and then in freedom's self</p>
<p>And virtue's self, then my own motives, ends</p>
<p>And aims and loves, and human love went last.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And then, with the loss of all these things of the soul which
bear a man's desires into the invisible <a name='Page124' id=
"Page124"></a><span class='pagenum'>124</span>and unreachable, he
gained the world, and success in it. All the powers of the mere
Intellect, that grey-haired deceiver whose name is Archimago, were
his;&mdash;wit, mockery, analytic force, keen reasoning on the
visible, the Understanding's absolute belief in itself; its close
grasp on what it called facts, and its clear application of
knowledge for clear ends. God, too, had vanished in this
intellectual satisfaction; and in the temple of his soul, where He
had been worshipped, troops of shadows now knelt to the man whose
intellect, having grasped all knowledge, was content; and hailed
him as king.</p>
<p>The position he describes is like that Wordsworth states in the
<i>Prelude</i> to have been his, when, after the vanishing of his
aspirations for man which followed the imperialistic fiasco of the
French Revolution, he found himself without love or hope, but with
full power to make an intellectual analysis of nature and of human
nature, and was destroyed thereby. It is the same position which
Paracelsus attains and which is followed by the same ruin. It is
also, so far as its results are concerned, the position of the Soul
described by Tennyson in <i>The Palace of Art</i>.</p>
<p>Love, emotion, God are shut out. Intellect and knowledge of the
world's work take their place. And the result is the slow corrosion
of the soul by pride. "I have nursed up energies," says Browning,
"they will prey on me." He feels this and breaks away from its
death. "My heart must worship," he cries. The "shadows" know this
feeling is against them, and they shout in answer:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Thyself, thou art our king!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page125' id="Page125"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>125</span>But the end of that is misery. Therefore he
begins to aspire again, but still, not for the infinite of
perfection beyond, but for a finite perfection on, the earth.</p>
<p>"I will make every joy here my own," he cries, "and then I will
die." "I will have one rapture to fill all the soul." "All
knowledge shall be mine." It is the aspiration of Paracelsus. "I
will live in the whole of Beauty, and here it shall be mine." It is
the aspiration of Aprile. "Then, having this perfect human soul,
master of all powers, I shall break forth, at some great crisis in
history, and lead the world." It is the very aspiration of
Sordello.</p>
<p>But when he tries for this, he finds failure at every point.
Everywhere he is limited; his soul demands what his body refuses to
fulfil; he is always baffled, falling short, chained down and
maddened by restrictions; unable to use what he conceives, to grasp
as a tool what he can reach in Thought; hating himself; imagining
what might be, and driven back from it in despair.</p>
<p>Even in his love for Pauline, in which he has skirted the
infinite and known that his soul cannot accept finality&mdash;he
finds that in him which is still unsatisfied.</p>
<p>What does this puzzle mean? "It means," he answers, "that this
earth's life is not my only sphere,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Can I so narrow sense but that in life</p>
<p>Soul still exceeds it?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Yet, he will try again. He has lived in all human life, and his
craving is still athirst. He has not <a name='Page126' id=
"Page126"></a><span class='pagenum'>126</span>yet tried Nature
herself. She seems to have undying beauty, and his feeling for her
is now, of course, doubled by his love for Pauline. "Come with me,"
he cries to her, "come out of the world into natural beauty"; and
there follows a noble description of a lovely country into which he
passes from a mountain glen&mdash;morning, noon, afternoon and
evening all described&mdash;and the emotion of the whole rises till
it reaches the topmost height of eagerness and joy, when, suddenly,
the whole fire is extinguished&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>I am concentrated&mdash;I feel;</p>
<p>But my soul saddens when it looks beyond:</p>
<p>I cannot be immortal, taste all joy.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>O God, where do they tend&mdash;these struggling aims?</p>
<p>What would I have? What is this "sleep" which seems</p>
<p>To bound all? Can there be a "waking" point</p>
<p>Of crowning life?</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>And what is that I hunger for but God?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, having worked towards perfection, having realised that he
cannot have it here, he sees at last that the failures of earth are
a prophecy of a perfection to come. He claims the infinite beyond.
"I believe," he cries, "in God and truth and love. Know my last
state is happy, free from doubt or touch of fear."</p>
<p>That is Browning all over. These are the motives of a crowd of
poems, varied through a crowd of examples; never better shaped than
in the trenchant and magnificent end of <i>Easter-Day</i>, where
the questions and answers are like the flashing and clashing of
sharp scimitars. Out of the same quarry from which <i>Pauline</i>
was hewn the rest were <a name='Page127' id=
"Page127"></a><span class='pagenum'>127</span>hewn. They are
polished, richly sculptured, hammered into fair form, but the stone
is the same. Few have been so consistent as Browning, few so true
to their early inspiration. He is among those happy warriors</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Who, when brought</p>
<p>Among the tasks of real life, have wrought</p>
<p>Upon the plan that pleased their boyish thought.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, then, is <i>Pauline</i>; I pass on to <i>Paracelsus</i>.
<i>Paracelsus</i>, in order to give the poem a little local colour,
opens at W&uuml;rzburg in a garden, and in the year 1512. But it is
not a poem which has to do with any place or any time. It belongs
only to the country of the human soul. The young student Paracelsus
is sitting with his friends Festus and Michal, on the eve of his
departure to conquer the whole world by knowledge. They make a last
effort to retain him, but even as he listens to their arguments his
eyes are far away&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As if where'er he gazed there stood a star,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>so strong, so deep is desire to attain his aim.</p>
<p>For Paracelsus aims to know the whole of knowledge. Quiet and
its charms, this homelike garden of still work, make their appeal
in vain. "God has called me," he cries; "these burning desires to
know all are his voice in me; and if I stay and plod on here, I
reject his call who has marked me from mankind. I must reach pure
knowledge. That is my only aim, my only reward."</p>
<p>Then Festus replies: "In this solitariness of aim, all other
interests of humanity are left out. Will knowledge, alone, give you
enough for life? You, a man!" And again: "You discern your <a name=
'Page128' id="Page128"></a><span class='pagenum'>128</span>purpose
clearly; have you any security of attaining it? Is it not more than
mortal power is capable of winning?" Or again: "Have you any
knowledge of the path to knowledge?" Or, once more, "Is anything in
your mind so clear as this, your own desire to be singly
famous?"</p>
<p>"All this is nothing," Paracelsus answers; "the restless force
within me will overcome all difficulties. God does not give that
fierce energy without giving also that which it desires. And, I am
chosen out of all the world to win this glory."</p>
<p>"Why not then," says Festus, "make use of knowledge already
gained? Work here; what knowledge will you gain in deserts?"</p>
<p>"I have tried all the knowledge of the past," Paracelsus
replies, "and found it a contemptible failure. Others were content
with the scraps they won. Not I! I want the whole; the source and
sum of divine and human knowledge, and though I craze as even one
truth expands its infinitude before me, I go forth alone, rejecting
all that others have done, to prove my own soul. I shall arrive at
last. And as to mankind, in winning perfect knowledge I shall serve
them; but then, all intercourse ends between them and me. I will
not be served by those I serve."</p>
<p>"Oh," answers Festus, "is that cause safe which produces
carelessness of human love? You have thrown aside all the helps of
human knowledge; now you reject all sympathy. No man can thrive who
dares to claim to serve the race, while he is bound by no single
tie to the race. You would be a being knowing not what Love
is&mdash;a monstrous spectacle!"</p>
<p>"<a name='Page129' id="Page129"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>129</span>That may be true," Paracelsus replies, "but for
the time I will have nothing to do with feeling. My affections
shall remain at rest, and then, <i>when</i> I have attained my
single aim, when knowledge is all mine, my affections will awaken
purified and chastened by my knowledge. Let me, unhampered by
sympathy, win my victory. And I go forth certain of victory."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Are there not, Festus, are there not, dear Michal,</p>
<p>Two points in the adventure of the diver:</p>
<p>One&mdash;when, a beggar, he prepares to plunge;</p>
<p>One&mdash;when, a prince, he rises with his pearl?</p>
<p>Festus, I plunge!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>FESTUS. We wait you when you rise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So ends the first part, and the second opens ten years
afterwards in a Greek Conjurer's house in Constantinople, with
Paracelsus writing down the result of his work. And the result is
this:</p>
<p>"I have made a few discoveries, but I could not stay to use
them. Nought remains but a ceaseless, hungry pressing forward, a
vision now and then of truth; and I&mdash;I am old before my hour:
the adage is true&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Time fleets, youth fades, life is an empty dream;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and now I would give a world to rest, even in failure!</p>
<p>"This is all my gain. Was it for this," he cries, "I subdued my
life, lost my youth, rooted out love; for the sake of this wolfish
thirst of knowledge?" No dog, said Faust, in Goethe's poem, driven
to the same point by the weariness of knowledge, no dog would
longer live this life. My tyrant aim has brought me into a desert;
worse still, the <a name='Page130' id="Page130"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>130</span>purity of my aim is lost. Can I truly say that
I have worked for man alone? Sadder still, if I had found that
which I sought, should I have had power to use it? O God, Thou who
art pure mind, spare my mind. Thus far, I have been a man. Let me
conclude, a man! Give me back one hour of my young energy, that I
may use and finish what I know.</p>
<p>"And God is good: I started sure of that; and he may still renew
my heart.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>True, I am worn;</p>
<p>But who clothes summer, who is life itself?</p>
<p>God, that created all things, can renew!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this moment the voice of Aprile is heard singing the song of
the poets, who, having great gifts, refused to use them, or abused
them, or were too weak; and who therefore live apart from God,
mourning for ever; who gaze on life, but live no more. He breaks in
on Paracelsus, and, in a long passage of overlapping thoughts,
Aprile&mdash;who would love infinitely and be loved, aspiring to
realise every form of love, as Paracelsus has aspired to realise
the whole of knowledge&mdash;makes Paracelsus feel that love is
what he wants. And then, when Paracelsus realises this, Aprile in
turn realises that he wants knowledge. Each recognises that he is
the complement of the other, that knowledge is worthless without
love, and love incapable of realising its aspirations without
knowledge&mdash;as if love did not contain the sum of knowledge
necessary for fine being. Both have failed; and it seems, at first,
that they failed because they did not combine their aims. But the
chief reason <a name='Page131' id="Page131"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>131</span>of their failure&mdash;and this is, indeed,
Browning's main point&mdash;is that each of them tried to do more
than our limits on earth permit. Paracelsus would have the whole
sum of knowledge, Aprile nothing less than the whole of love, and,
in this world. It is impossible; yet, were it possible, could they
have attained the sum of knowledge and of love on earth and been
satisfied therewith, they would have shut out the infinite of
knowledge and love beyond them in the divine land, and been, in
their satisfaction, more hopelessly lost than they are in their
present wretchedness. Failure that leaves an unreached ideal before
the soul is in reality a greater boon than success which thinks
perfect satisfaction has been reached. Their aim at perfection is
right: what is wrong is their view that failure is ruin, and not a
prophecy of a greater glory to come. Could they have thought
perfection were attained on earth&mdash;were they satisfied with
anything this world can give, no longer stung with hunger for the
infinite&mdash;all Paradise, with the illimitable glories, were
closed to them!</p>
<p>Few passages are more beautiful in English poetry than that in
which Aprile narrates his youthful aspiration: how, loving all
things infinitely, he wished to throw them into absolute beauty of
form by means of all the arts, for the love of men, and receive
from men love for having revealed beauty, and merge at last in God,
the Eternal Love. This was his huge aim, his full desire.</p>
<p>Few passages are more pathetic than that in which he tells his
failure and its cause. "Time is short; the means of life are
limited; we have <a name='Page132' id="Page132"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>132</span>no means answering to our desires. Now I am
wrecked; for the multitudinous images of beauty which filled my
mind forbade my seizing upon one which I could have shaped. I often
wished to give one to the world, but the others came round and
baffled me; and, moreover, I could not leave the multitude of
beauty for the sake of one beauty. Unless I could embody all I
would embody none.</p>
<p>"And, afterwards, when a cry came from man, 'Give one ray even
of your hoarded light to us,' and I tried for man's sake to select
one, why, then, mists came&mdash;old memories of a thousand
sweetnesses, a storm of images&mdash;till it was impossible to
choose; and so I failed, and life is ended.</p>
<p>"But could I live I would do otherwise. I would give a trifle
out of beauty, as an example by which men could guess the rest and
love it all; one strain from an angel's song; one flower from the
distant land, that men might know that such things were. Then, too,
I would put common life into loveliness, so that the lowest hind
would find me beside him to put his weakest hope and fear into
noble language. And as I thus lived with men, and for them, I
should win from them thoughts fitted for their progress, the very
commonest of which would come forth in beauty, for they would have
been born in a soul filled full of love. This should now be my aim:
no longer that desire to embrace the whole of beauty which isolates
a man from his fellows; but to realise enough of loveliness to give
pleasure to men who desire to love. Therefore, I should live, still
aspiring to the whole, still uncontent, but waiting for another
life to gain the whole; but at the same time content, for man's
sake, <a name='Page133' id="Page133"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>133</span>to work within the limitations of life; not
grieving either for failure, because love given and received makes
failure pleasure. In truth, the failure to grasp all on earth
makes, if we love, the certainty of a success beyond the
earth."</p>
<p>And Paracelsus listening and applying what Aprile says to his
old desire to grasp, apart from men, the whole of knowledge as
Aprile had desired to grasp the whole of love, learns the truth at
last, and confesses it:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Love me henceforth, Aprile, while I learn</p>
<p>To love; and, merciful God, forgive us both!</p>
<p>We wake at length from weary dreams; but both</p>
<p>Have slept in fairy-land: though dark and drear</p>
<p>Appears the world before us, we no less</p>
<p>Wake with our wrists and ankles jewelled still.</p>
<p>I too have sought to KNOW as thou to LOVE&mdash;</p>
<p>Excluding love as thou refusedst knowledge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We are halves of a dissevered world, and we must never part till
the Knower love, and thou, the Lover, know, and both are saved.</p>
<p>"No, no; that is not all," Aprile answers, and dies. "Our
perfection is not in ourselves but in God. Not our strength, but
our weakness is our glory. Not in union with me, with earthly love
alone, will you find the perfect life. I am not that you seek. It
is God the King of Love, his world beyond, and the infinite
creations Love makes in it."</p>
<p>But Paracelsus does not grasp that last conclusion. He only
understands that he has left out love in his aim, and therefore
failed. He does not give up the notion of attainment upon earth. He
cannot lose the first imprint of his idea of himself&mdash;his
lonely grasp of the whole of Knowledge.</p>
<p>The next two parts of the poem do not strengthen <a name=
'Page134' id="Page134"></a><span class='pagenum'>134</span>much the
main thoughts. Paracelsus tries to work out the lesson learnt from
Aprile&mdash;to add love to knowledge, to aspire to that fulness in
God. But he does not love enough. He despises those who follow him
for the sake of his miracles, yet he desires their worship.
Moreover, the pride of knowledge still clings to him; he cannot
help thinking it higher than love; and the two together drive him
into the thought that this world must give him satisfaction. So, he
puts aside the ideal aim. But here also he is baffled. Those who
follow him as the great teacher ask of him signs. He gives these;
and he finds at Basel that he has sunk into the desire of vulgar
fame, and prostituted his knowledge; and, sick of this, beaten back
from his noble ambitions, he determines to have something at least
out of earth, and chooses at Colmar the life of sensual pleasure.
"I still aspire," he cries. "I will give the night to study, but I
will keep the day for the enjoyment of the senses. Thus, intellect
and sense woven together, I shall at least have attained something.
If I do not gain knowledge I shall have gained sensual pleasure.
Man I despise and hate, and God has deceived me. I take the world."
But, even while he says this, his ancient aspiration lives so much
in him that he scorns himself for his fall as much as he scorns the
crowd.</p>
<p>Then comes the last scene, when, at Salzburg, he returns to find
his friend Festus, and to die. In the hour of his death he reviews
his whole life, his aims, their failure and the reason of it, and
yet dies triumphant for he has found the truth.</p>
<p>I pass over the pathetic delirium in which <a name='Page135' id=
"Page135"></a><span class='pagenum'>135</span>Paracelsus thinks
that Aprile is present, and cries for his hand and sympathy while
Festus is watching by the couch. At last he wakes, and knows his
friend, and that he is dying. "I am happy," he cries; "my foot is
on the threshold of boundless life; I see the whole whirl and
hurricane of life behind me; all my life passes by, and I know its
purpose, to what end it has brought me, and whither I am going. I
will tell you all the meaning of life. Festus, my friend, tell it
to the world.</p>
<p>"There was a time when I was happy; the secret of life was in
that happiness." "When, when was that?" answers Festus, "all I hope
that answer will decide."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>PAR. When, but the time I vowed myself to man?</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>FEST. Great God, thy judgments are inscrutable!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then he explains. "There are men, so majestical is our nature,
who, hungry for joy and truth, win more and more of both, and know
that life is infinite progress in God. This they win by long and
slow battle. But there are those, of whom I was one"&mdash;and here
Browning draws the man of genius&mdash;"who are born at the very
point to which these others, the men of talent, have painfully
attained. By intuition genius knows, and I knew at once, what God
is, what we are, what life is. Alas! I could not use the knowledge
aright. There is an answer to the passionate longings of the heart
for fulness, and I knew it. And the answer is this: Live in all
things outside of yourself by love and you will have joy. That is
the life of God; it ought to be our life. In him it is accomplished
and perfect; <a name='Page136' id="Page136"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>136</span>but in all created things it is a lesson
learned slowly against difficulty.</p>
<p>"Thus I knew the truth, but I was led away from it. I broke down
from thinking of myself, my fame, and of this world. I had not love
enough, and I lost the truth for a time. But whatever my failures
were, I never lost sight of it altogether. I never was content with
myself or with the earth. Out of my misery I cried for the joy God
has in living outside of himself in love of all things."</p>
<p>Then, thrilled with this thought, he breaks forth into a most
noble description&mdash;new in English poetry, new in feeling and
in thought, enough of itself to lift Browning on to his lofty
peak&mdash;first of the joy of God in the Universe he makes
incessantly by pouring out of himself his life, and, secondly, of
the joy of all things in God. "Where dwells enjoyment there is He."
But every realised enjoyment looks forward, even in God, to a new
and higher sphere of distant glory, and when that is reached, to
another sphere beyond&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>thus climbs</p>
<p>Pleasure its heights for ever and for ever.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Creation is God's joyous self-giving. The building of the frame
of earth was God's first joy in Earth. That made him conceive a
greater joy&mdash;the joy of clothing the earth, of making life
therein&mdash;of the love which in animals, and last in man,
multiplies life for ever.</p>
<p>So there is progress of all things to man, and all created
things before his coming have&mdash;in beauty, in power, in
knowledge, in dim shapes of love and trust in the animals&mdash;had
prophecies of him which man <a name='Page137' id=
"Page137"></a><span class='pagenum'>137</span>has realised, hints
and previsions, dimly picturing the higher race, till man appeared
at last, and one stage of being was complete. But the law of
progress does not cease now man has come. None of his faculties are
perfect. They also by their imperfection suggest a further life, in
which as all that was unfinished in the animals suggested man, so
also that which is unfinished in us suggests ourselves in higher
place and form. Man's self is not yet Man.</p>
<p>We learn this not only from our own boundless desires for higher
life, and from our sense of imperfection. We learn it also when we
look back on the whole of nature that was before we were. We
illustrate and illuminate all that has been. Nature is humanised,
spiritualised by us. We have imprinted ourselves on all things; and
this, as we realise it, as we give thought and passion to lifeless
nature, makes us understand how great we are, and how much greater
we are bound to be. We are the end of nature but not the end of
ourselves. We learn the same truth when among us the few men of
genius appear; stars in the darkness. We do not say&mdash;These
stand alone; we never can become as they. On the contrary, we cry:
All are to be what these are, and more. They longed for more, and
we and they shall have it. All shall be perfected; and then, and
not till then, begins the new age and the new life, new progress
and new joy. This is the ultimate truth.</p>

man&mdash;and here Browning repeats himself&mdash;so in man there

even the general tendency, and conceive the very highest, and live

conceive it.</p>
<p>"I, Paracelsus," he cries&mdash;and now Browning repeats the
whole argument of the poem&mdash;"was one of these. To do this I
vowed myself, soul and limb.</p>
<p>"But I mistook my means, I took the wrong path, led away by
pride. I gazed on power alone, and on power won by knowledge alone.
This I thought was the only note and aim of man, and it was to be
won, at once and in the present, without any care for all that man
had already done. I rejected all the past. I despised it as a
record of weakness and disgrace. Man should be all-sufficient now;
a single day should bring him to maturity. He has power to reach
the whole of knowledge at one leap.</p>
<p>"In that, I mistook the conditions of life. I did not see our
barriers; nor that progress is slow; nor that every step of the
past is necessary to know and to remember; nor that, in the shade
of the past, the present stands forth bright; nor that the future
is not to be all at once, but to dawn on us, in zone after zone of
quiet progress. I strove to laugh down all the limits of our life,
and then the smallest things broke me down&mdash;me, who tried to
realise the <a name='Page139' id="Page139"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>139</span>impossible on earth. At last I knew that the
power I sought was only God's, and then I prayed to die. All my
life was failure.</p>
<p>"At this crisis I met Aprile, and learned my deep mistake. I had
left love out; and love and knowledge, and power through knowledge,
must go together. And Aprile had also failed, for he had sought
love and rejected knowledge. Life can only move when both are hand
in hand:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>love preceding</p>
<p>Power, and with much power, always much more love:</p>
<p>Love still too straitened in its present means,</p>
<p>And earnest for new power to set love free.</p>
<p>I learned this, and supposed the whole was learned.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"But to learn it, and to fulfil it, are two different things. I
taught the simple truth, but men would not have it. They sought the
complex, the sensational, the knowledge which amazed them. And for
this knowledge they praised me. I loathed and despised their
praise; and when I would not give them more of the signs and
wonders I first gave them, they avenged themselves by casting shame
on my real knowledge. Then I was tempted, and became the charlatan;
and yet despised myself for seeking man's praise for that which was
most contemptible in me. Then I sought for wild pleasure in the
senses, and I hated myself still more. And hating myself I came to
hate men; and then all that Aprile taught to me was lost.</p>
<p>"But now I know that I did not love enough to trace beneath the
hate of men their love. I did not love enough to see in their
follies the grain of divine wisdom.</p>

<p>"I did not see this, I did not love enough to see this, and I

the whole of love for beauty's sake&mdash;and regarding both, shape
forth a third and better-tempered spirit, in whom beauty and
knowledge, love and power, shall mingle into one, and lead Man up

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3><i>THE POET OF ART</i></h3>
<p>The theory of human life which Browning conceived, and which I
attempted in the last chapter to explain out of <i>Pauline</i> and
<i>Paracelsus</i>, underlies the poems which have to do with the
arts. Browning as the poet of Art is as fascinating a subject as
Browning the poet of Nature; even more so, for he directed of set
purpose a great deal of his poetry to the various arts, especially
to music and painting. Nor has he neglected to write about his own
art. The lover in Pauline is a poet. Paracelsus and Aprile have
both touched that art. Sordello is a poet, and so are many others
in the poems. Moreover, he treats continually of himself as a poet,
and of the many criticisms on his work.</p>
<p>All through this work on the arts, the theory of which we have
written appears continuously. It emerges fully in the close of
<i>Easter-Day</i>. It is carefully wrought into poems like <i>Abt
Vogler</i> and <i>A Grammarian's Funeral</i>, in which the pursuit
of grammar is conceived of as the pursuit of an art. It is
introduced by the way in the midst of subjects belonging to the art
of painting, as in <i>Old Pictures in Florence</i> and <i>Andrea
del Sarto</i>. Finally, in those poems which represent in vivid
colour and selected <a name='Page142' id="Page142"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>142</span>personalities special times and forms of art,
the theory still appears, but momentarily, as a dryad might show
her face in a wood to a poet passing by. I shall be obliged then to
touch again and again on this theory of his in discussing Browning
as the poet of the arts. This is a repetition which cannot be
helped, but for which I request the pardon of my readers.</p>
<p>The subject of the arts, from the time when Caliban "fell to
make something" to the re-birth of naturalism in Florence, from the
earliest music and poetry to the latest, interested Browning
profoundly; and he speaks of them, not as a critic from the
outside, but out of the soul of them, as an artist. He is, for
example, the only poet of the nineteenth century till we come to
Rossetti, who has celebrated painting and sculpture by the art of
poetry; and Rossetti did not link these arts to human life and
character with as much force and penetration as Browning. Morris,
when he wrote poetry, did not care to write about the other arts,
their schools or history. He liked to describe in verse the
beautiful things of the past, but not to argue on their how and
why. Nor did he ever turn in on himself as artist, and ask how he
wrote poetry or how he built up a pattern. What he did as artist
was to <i>make</i>, and when he had made one thing to make another.
He ran along like Pheidippides to his goal, without halting for one
instant to consider the methods of his running. And all his life
long this was his way.</p>
<p>Rossetti described a picture in a sonnet with admirable skill,
so admirable that we say to ourselves&mdash;"Give me the picture or
the sonnet, not <a name='Page143' id="Page143"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>143</span>both. They blot out one another." But to
describe a picture is not to write about art. The one place where
he does go down to its means and soul is in his little prose
masterpiece, <i>Hand and Soul</i>, in which we see the path, the
goal, the passion, but not the power of art. But he never, in
thought, got, like Browning, to the bottom-joy of it. He does not
seem to see, as clearly as Browning saw, that the source of all art
was love; and that the expression of love in beautiful form was or
ought to be accomplished with that exulting joy which is the
natural child of self-forgetfulness. This story of Rossetti's was
in prose. In poetry, Rossetti, save in description from the
outside, left art alone; and Browning's special work on art, and
particularly his poetic studies of it, are isolated in English
poetry, and separate him from other poets.</p>
<p>I cannot wish that he had thought less and written less about
other arts than poetry. But I do wish he had given more time and
trouble to his own art, that we might have had clearer and lovelier
poetry. Perhaps, if he had developed himself with more care as an
artist in his own art, he would not have troubled himself or his
art by so much devotion to abstract thinking and intellectual
analysis. A strange preference also for naked facts sometimes beset
him, as if men wanted these from a poet. It was as if some
scientific demon entered into him for a time and turned poetry out,
till Browning got weary of his guest and threw him out of the
window. These reversions to some far off Browning in the past, who
was deceived into thinking the intellect the king of life,
enfeebled and <a name='Page144' id="Page144"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>144</span>sometimes destroyed the artist in him; and
though he escaped for the best part of his poetry from this
position, it was not seldom in his later years as a brand plucked
from the burning. Moreover, he recognised this tendency in himself;
and protested against it, sometimes humorously, sometimes
seriously. At least so I read what he means in a number of poems,
when he turns, after an over-wrought piece of analysis, upon
himself, and bursts out of his cobwebs into a solution of the
question by passion and imagination. Nevertheless the charm of this
merely intellectual play pulled at him continually, and as he could
always embroider it with fancy it seemed to him close to
imagination; and this belief grew upon him as he got farther away
from the warmth and natural truth of youth. It is the melancholy
tendency of some artists, as they feel the weakness of decay, to
become scientific; and a fatal temptation it is. There is one poem
of his in which he puts the whole matter clearly and happily, with
a curious and suggestive title, "<i>Transcendentalism</i>: A Poem
in Twelve Books."</p>
<p>He speaks to a young poet who will give to men "naked thought,
good, true, treasurable stuff, solid matter, without imaginative
imagery, without emotion."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thought's what they mean by verse, and seek in verse.</p>
<p>Boys seek for images and melody,</p>
<p>Men must have reason&mdash;so, you aim at men.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is "quite otherwise," Browning tells him, and he illustrates
the matter by a story.</p>
<p>Jacob B&ouml;hme did not care for plants. All he cared for was
his mysticism. But one day, as if <a name='Page145' id=
"Page145"></a><span class='pagenum'>145</span>the magic of poetry
had slipped into his soul, he heard all the plants talking, and
talking to him; and behold, he loved them and knew what they meant.
Imagination had done more for him than all his metaphysics. So we
give up our days to collating theory with theory, criticising,
philosophising, till, one morning, we wake "and find life's summer
past."</p>
<p>What remedy? What hope? Why, a brace of rhymes! And then, in
life, that miracle takes place which John of Halberstadt did by his
magic. We feel like a child; the world is new; every bit of life is
run over and enchanted by the wild rose.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And in there breaks the sudden rose herself,</p>
<p>Over us, under, round us every side,</p>
<p>Nay, in and out the tables and the chairs</p>
<p>And musty volumes, Boehme's book and all&mdash;Buries</p>
<p>us with a glory, young once more,</p>
<p>Pouring heaven into this shut house of life.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>So come, the harp back to your heart again!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I return, after this introduction, to Browning's doctrine of
life as it is connected with the arts. It appears with great
clearness in <i>Easter-Day</i>. He tells of an experience he had
when, one night, musing on life, and wondering how it would be with
him were he to die and be judged in a moment, he walked on the wild
common outside the little Dissenting Chapel he had previously
visited on Christmas-Eve and thought of the Judgment. And
Common-sense said: "You have done your best; do not be dismayed;
you will only be surprised, and when the shock is over you will
smile at your fear." And as he thought thus the whole sky became a
sea of fire. A fierce and vindictive <a name='Page146' id=
"Page146"></a><span class='pagenum'>146</span>scribble of red quick
flame ran across it, and the universe was burned away. "And I
knew," thought Browning, "now that Judgment had come, that I had
chosen this world, its beauty, its knowledge, its good&mdash;that,
though I often looked above, yet to renounce utterly the beauty of
this earth and man was too hard for me." And a voice came:
"Eternity is here, and thou art judged." And then Christ stood
before him and said: "Thou hast preferred the finite when the
infinite was in thy power. Earthly joys were palpable and tainted.
The heavenly joys flitted before thee, faint, and rare, and
taintless. Thou hast chosen those of this world. They are
thine."</p>
<p>"O rapture! is this the Judgment? Earth's exquisite treasures of
wonder and delight for me!"</p>
<p>"So soon made happy," said the voice. "The loveliness of earth
is but like one rose flung from the Eden whence thy choice has
excluded thee. The wonders of earth are but the tapestry of the
ante-chamber in the royal house thou hast abandoned.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>All partial beauty was a pledge</p>
<p>Of beauty in its plenitude:</p>
<p>But since the pledge sufficed thy mood,</p>
<p>Retain it! plenitude be theirs</p>
<p>Who looked above!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"O sharp despair! but since the joys of earth fail me, I take
art. Art gives worth to nature; it stamps it with man. I'll take
the Greek sculpture, the perfect painting of Italy&mdash;that world
is mine!"</p>
<p>"Then obtain it," said the voice: "the one abstract form, the
one face with its one look&mdash;all they could manage. Shall I,
the illimitable beauty, <a name='Page147' id=
"Page147"></a><span class='pagenum'>147</span>be judged by these
single forms? What of that perfection in their souls these artists
were conscious of, inconceivably exceeding all they did? What of
their failure which told them an illimitable beauty was before
them? What of Michael Angelo now, who did not choose the world's
success or earth's perfection, and who now is on the breast of the
Divine? All the beauty of art is but furniture for life's first
stage. Take it then. But there are those, my saints, who were not
content, like thee, with earth's scrap of beauty, but desired the
whole. They are now filled with it. Take thy one jewel of beauty on
the beach; lose all I had for thee in the boundless ocean."</p>
<p>"Then I take mind; earth's knowledge carries me beyond the
finite. Through circling sciences, philosophies and histories I
will spin with rapture; and if these fail to inspire, I will fly to
verse, and in its dew and fire break the chain which binds me to
the earth;&mdash;Nay, answer me not, I know what Thou wilt say:
What is highest in knowledge, even those fine intuitions which lead
the finite into the infinite, and which are best put in noble
verse, are but gleams of a light beyond them, sparks from the sum
of the whole. I give that world up also, and I take Love. All I ask
is leave to love."</p>
<p>"Ah," said the voice, "is this thy final choice? Love is the
best; 'tis somewhat late. Yet all the power and beauty, nature and
art and knowledge of this earth were only worth because of love.
Through them infinite love called to thee; and even now thou
clingest to earth's love as all. It is precious, but it exists to
bear thee beyond the love of earth into the boundless love of God
in me." <a name='Page148' id="Page148"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>148</span>At last, beaten to his last fortress, all
broken down, he cries:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Thou Love of God! Or let me die,</p>
<p>Or grant what shall seem heaven almost.</p>
<p>Let me not know that all is lost,</p>
<p>Though lost it be&mdash;leave me not tied</p>
<p>To this despair&mdash;this corpse-like bride!</p>
<p>Let that old life seem mine&mdash;no more&mdash;</p>
<p>With limitation as before,</p>
<p>With darkness, hunger, toil, distress:</p>
<p>Be all the earth a wilderness!</p>
<p>Only let me go on, go on,</p>
<p>Still hoping ever and anon</p>
<p>To reach one eve the Better Land!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is put more strongly, as in the line: "Be all the earth a
wilderness!" than Browning himself would have put it. But he is in
the passion of the man who speaks, and heightens the main truth
into an extreme. But the theory is there, and it is especially
applied to the love of beauty and therefore to the arts. The
illustrations are taken from music and painting, from sculpture and
poetry. Only in dwelling too exclusively, as perhaps the situation
demands, on the renunciation of this world's successes, he has left
out that part of his theory which demands that we should, accepting
our limits, work within them for the love of man, but learn from
their pressure and pain to transcend them always in the desire of
infinite perfection. In <i>Rabbi Ben Ezra</i>, a masterpiece of
argumentative and imaginative passion&mdash;such a poem as only
Browning could have written, who, more than other poets, equalised,
when most inspired, reasoning, emotions and intuitions into one
material for poetry&mdash;he applies this view of his to the whole
of man's life here and in the world to come, when the <a name=
'Page149' id="Page149"></a><span class='pagenum'>149</span>Rabbi in
the quiet of old age considers what his life has been, and how God
has wrought him through it for eternity. But I leave that poem,
which has nothing to do with art, for <i>Abt Vogler</i>, which is
dedicated to music.</p>
<p>"When Solomon pronounced the Name of God, all the spirits, good
and bad, assembled to do his will and build his palace. And when I,
Abt Vogler, touched the keys, I called the Spirits of Sound to me,
and they have built my palace of music; and to inhabit it all the
Great Dead came back, till in the vision I made a perfect music.
Nay, for a moment, I touched in it the infinite perfection; but now
it is gone; I cannot bring it back. Had I painted it, had I written
it, I might have explained it. But in music, out of the sounds
something emerges which is above the sounds, and that ineffable
thing I touched and lost. I took the well-known sounds of earth,
and out of them came a fourth sound, nay, not a sound&mdash;but a
star. This was a flash of God's will which opened the Eternal to me
for a moment; and I shall find it again in the eternal life.
Therefore, from the achievement of earth and the failure of it, I
turn to God, and in him I see that every image, thought, impulse,
and dream of knowledge or of beauty&mdash;which, coming whence we
know not, flit before us in human life, breathe for a moment, and
then depart; which, like my music, build a sudden palace in
imagination; which abide for an instant and dissolve, but which
memory and hope retain as a ground of aspiration&mdash;are not lost
to us though they seem to die in their immediate passage. Their
music has its home in the Will of God and we shall find them
completed there.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page150' id="Page150"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>150</p>
<p>All we have willed or hoped or dreamed of good shall exist;</p>
<p class='i2'>Not its semblance, but itself; no beauty, nor good,
nor power</p>
<p>Whose voice has gone forth, but each survives for the
melodist</p>
<p class='i2'>When eternity affirms the conception of an hour.</p>
<p>The high that proved too high, the heroic for earth too
hard,</p>
<p class='i2'>The passion that left the ground to lose itself in
the sky,</p>
<p>Are music sent up to God by the lover and the bard;</p>
<p class='i2'>Enough that he heard it once: we shall hear it
by-and-by.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>Well, it is earth with me; silence resumes her reign:</p>
<p class='i2'>I will be patient and proud, and soberly
acquiesce.</p>
<p>Give me the keys. I feel for the common chord again,</p>
<p class='i2'>Sliding by semitones, till I sink to the
minor,&mdash;yes,</p>
<p>And I blunt it into a ninth, and I stand on alien ground,</p>
<p class='i2'>Surveying awhile the heights I rolled from into the
deep;</p>
<p>Which, hark, I have dared and done, for my resting-place is
found,</p>
<p class='i2'>The C Major of this life: so, now I will try to
sleep."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With that he returns to human life, content to labour in its
limits&mdash;the common chord is his. But he has been where he
shall be, and he is not likely to be satisfied with the C major of
life. This, in Browning's thought, is the true comfort and strength
of the life of the artist, to whom these fallings from us,
vanishings, these transient visits of the infinite Divine, like
swallows that pass in full flight, are more common than to other
men. They tell him of the unspeakable beauty; they let loose his
spirit to fly into the third heaven.</p>
<p>So much for the theory in this poem. As to the artist and his
art in it, that is quite a different matter; and as there are few
of Browning's poems which reach a higher level than this both in
form, thought, and spiritual passion, it may be worth while, for
once, to examine a poem of his at large.</p>
<p>Browning's imagination conceived in a moment the musician's
experience from end to end; and the <a name='Page151' id=
"Page151"></a><span class='pagenum'>151</span>form of the
experience arose along with the conception. He saw Abt Vogler in
the silent church, playing to himself before the golden towers of
the organ, and slipping with sudden surprise into a strain which is
less his than God's. He saw the vision which accompanied the music,
and the man's heart set face to face with the palace of music he
had built. He saw him live in it and then pass to heaven with it
and lose it. And he saw the close of the experience, with all its
scenery in the church and in Abt Vogler's heart, at the same time,
in one vision. In this unconscious shaping of his thought into a
human incident, with its soul and scenery, is the imagination
creating, like a god, a thing unknown, unseen before.</p>
<p>Having thus shaped the form, the imagination passed on to make
the ornament. It creates that far-off image of Solomon and his
spirits building their palace for the Queen of Sheba which exalts
the whole conception and enlarges the reader's imagination through
all the legends of the great King&mdash;and then it makes, for
fresh adornment, the splendid piling up of the sounds into walls of
gold, pinnacles, splendours and meteor moons; and lastly, with
upward sweeping of its wings, bids the sky to fall in love with the
glory of the palace, and the mighty forms of the noble Dead to walk
in it. This is the imagination at play with its conception,
adorning, glorifying, heightening the full impression, but keeping
every imaged ornament misty, impalpable, as in a dream&mdash;for so
the conception demanded.</p>
<p>And then, to fill the conception with the spirit of humanity,
the personal passion of the poet rises and falls through the
description, as the music <a name='Page152' id=
"Page152"></a><span class='pagenum'>152</span>rises and falls. We
feel his breast beating against ours; till the time comes when,
like a sudden change in a great song, his emotion changes into
ecstasy in the outburst of the 9th verse:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Therefore to whom turn I but to thee, the ineffable Name?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It almost brings tears into the eyes. This is
art-creation&mdash;this is what imagination, intense emotion, and
individuality have made of the material of thought&mdash;poetry,
not prose.</p>
<p>Even at the close, the conception, the imagination, and the
personal passion keep their art. The rush upwards of the
imaginative feeling dies slowly away; it is as evanescent as the
Vision of the Palace, but it dies into another picture of humanity
which even more deeply engages the human heart. Browning sees the
organ-loft now silent and dark, and the silent figure in it, alone
and bowed over the keys. The church is still, but aware of what has
been. The golden pipes of the organ are lost in the twilight and
the music is over&mdash;all the double vision of the third heaven
into which he has been caught has vanished away. The form of the
thing rightly fits the idea. Then, when the form is shaped, the
poet fills it with the deep emotion of the musician's soul, and
then with his own emotion; and close as the air to the earth are
the sorrow and exultation of Abt Vogler and Browning to the human
heart&mdash;sorrow for the vanishing and the failure, exultant joy
because what has been is but an image of the infinite beauty they
will have in God. In the joy they do not sorrow for the failure. It
is nothing but an omen of success. Their soul, greater than the
vision, takes <a name='Page153' id="Page153"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>153</span>up common life with patience and silent hope.
We hear them sigh and strike the chord of C.</p>
<p>This is lyric imagination at work in lyric poetry. There are two
kinds of lyrics among many others. One is where the strong emotion
of the poet, fusing all his materials into one creation, comes to a
height and then breaks off suddenly. It is like a thunderstorm,
which, doubling and redoubling its flash and roar, ends in the
zenith with the brightest flash and loudest clang of thunder. There
is another kind. It is when the storm of emotion reaches, like the
first, its climax, but does not end with it. The lyric passion dies
slowly away from the zenith to the horizon, and ends in quietude
and beauty, attended by soft colour and gentle sounds; like the
thunderstorm which faints with the sunset and gathers its clouds to
be adorned with beauty. This lyric of Browning's is a noble example
of the second type.</p>
<p>I take another poem, the <i>Grammarian's Funeral</i>, to
illustrate his art. The main matter of thought in it is the same as
that of <i>Abt Vogler</i>, with the variation that the central
figure is not a musician but a grammarian; that what he pursued was
critical knowledge, not beauty, and that he is not a modern, like
Abt Vogler, but one of the Renaissance folk, and seized, as men
were seized then, with that insatiable curiosity which
characterised the outbreak of the New Learning. The matter of
thought in it is of less interest to us than the poetic creation
wrought out of it, or than the art with which it is done. We see
the form into which the imaginative conception is thrown&mdash;the
group of sorrowing students carrying their master's corpse to the
high <a name='Page154' id="Page154"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>154</span>platform of the mountain, singing what he was,
in admiration and honour and delight that he had mastered life and
won eternity; a conception full of humanity, as full of the life of
the dead master's soul as of the students' enthusiasm. This thrills
us into creation, with the poet, as we read. Then the imagination
which has made the conception into form adorns it. It creates the
plain, the encircling mountains, one cloudy peak higher than the
rest; as we mount we look on the plain below; we reach the city on
the hill, pass it, and climb the hill-top; there are all the
high-flying birds, the meteors, the lightnings, the thickest dew.
And we lay our dead on the peak, above the plain. This is the
scenery, the imaginative ornament, and all through it we are made
to hear the chant of the students; and so lifting is the melody of
the verse we seem to taste the air, fresher and fresher as we
climb. Then, finally, into the midst of this flows for us the eager
intensity of the scholar. Dead as he is, we feel him to be alive;
never resting, pushing on incessantly, beating failure beneath his
feet, making it the step for further search for the infinite,
resolute to live in the dull limits of the present work, but never
content save in waiting for that eternity which will fulfil the
failure of earth; which, missing earth's success, throws itself on
God, dying to gain the highest. This is the passion of the poem,
and Browning is in it like a fire. It was his own, his very life.
He pours it into the students who rejoice in the death of their
master, and he gives it to us as we read the poem. And then,
because conception, imagination, and intensity of thought and
emotion all here work together, as in <i>Abt Vogler</i>, <a name=
'Page155' id="Page155"></a><span class='pagenum'>155</span>the
melody of the poem is lovely, save in one verse which ought to be
out of the poem. As to the conclusion, it is priceless. Such a
conclusion can only emerge when all that precedes it finely
contains it, and I have often thought that it pictures Browning
himself. I wish he had been buried on a mountain top, all Italy
below him.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Well, here's the platform, here's the proper place:</p>
<p class='i2'>Hail to your purlieus,</p>
<p>All ye high-flyers of the feathered race,</p>
<p class='i2'>Swallows and curlews!</p>
<p>Here's the top-peak; the multitude below</p>
<p class='i2'>Live, for they can, there:</p>
<p>This man decided not to Live but Know&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'>Bury this man there?</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Here&mdash;here's his place, where meteors shoot, clouds
form,</p>
<p class='i2'>Lightenings are loosened.</p>
<p>Stars come and go! Let joy break with the storm,</p>
<p class='i2'>Peace let the dew send!</p>
<p>Lofty designs must close in like effects:</p>
<p class='i2'>Loftily lying,</p>
<p>Leave him&mdash;still loftier than the world suspects,</p>
<p class='i2'>Living and dying.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the artist at work, and I doubt whether all the
laborious prose written, in history and criticism, on the revival
of learning, will ever express better than this short poem the
inexhaustible thirst of the Renaissance in its pursuit of
knowledge, or the enthusiasm of the pupils of a New Scholar for his
desperate strife to know in a short life the very centre of the
Universe.</p>
<p>Another poem on the arts which is mixed up with Browning's
theory of life is <i>Andrea del Sarto</i>. Into it the theory
slips, like an uninvited guest into a dinner-party of whom it is
felt that he has some relation to some one of the guests, but for
whom no <a name='Page156' id="Page156"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>156</span>cover is laid. The faulty and broken life of
Andrea, in its contrast with his flawless drawing, has been a
favourite subject with poets. Alfred de Musset and others have
dramatised it, and it seems strange that none of our soul-wrecking
and vivisecting novelists have taken it up for their amusement.
Browning has not left out a single point of the subject. The only
criticism I should make of this admirable poem is that, when we
come to the end, we dislike the woman and despise the man more than
we pity either of them; and in tragic art-work of a fine quality,
pity for human nature with a far-off tenderness in it should remain
as the most lasting impression. All the greater artists, even while
they went to the bottom of sorrow and wickedness, have done this
wise and beautiful thing, and Browning rarely omits it.</p>
<p>The first art-matter in the poem is Browning's sketch of the
sudden genesis of a picture. Andrea is sitting with his wife on the
window-seat looking out to Fiesole. As he talks she smiles a weary,
lovely, autumn smile, and, born in that instant and of her smile,
he sees his picture, knows its atmosphere, realises its tone of
colour, feels its prevailing sentiment. How he will execute it is
another question, and depends on other things; but no better sketch
could be given of the sudden spiritual fashion in which great
pictures are generated. Here are the lines, and they also strike
the keynote of Andrea's soul&mdash;that to which his life has
brought him.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>You smile? why, there's my picture ready made,</p>
<p>There's what we painters call our harmony!</p>
<p>A common greyness silvers everything,&mdash;</p>
<a name='Page157' id="Page157"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>157</p>
<p>All in a twilight, you and I alike&mdash;,</p>
<p>You at the point of your first pride in me</p>
<p>(That's gone, you know),&mdash;but I, at every point;</p>
<p>My youth, my hope, my art, being all toned down</p>
<p>To yonder sober pleasant Fiesole.</p>
<p>There's the bell clinking from the chapel-top;</p>
<p>That length of convent-wall across the way</p>
<p>Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;</p>
<p>The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,</p>
<p>And autumn grows, autumn in everything.</p>
<p>Eh? the whole seems to fall into a shape</p>
<p>As if I saw alike my work and self</p>
<p>And all that I was born to be and do,</p>
<p>A twilight piece. Love, we are in God's hand.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In God's hand? Yes, but why being free are we so fettered? And
here slips in the unbidden guest of the theory. Andrea has chosen
earthly love; Lucrezia is all in all; and he has reached absolute
perfection in drawing&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I do what many dream of, all their lives.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He can reach out beyond himself no more. He has got the earth,
lost the heaven. He makes no error, and has, therefore, no
impassioned desire which, flaming through the faulty picture, makes
it greater art than his faultless work. "The soul is gone from me,
that vext, suddenly-impassioned, upward-rushing thing, with its
play, insight, broken sorrows, sudden joys, pursuing, uncontented
life. These men reach a heaven shut out from me, though they cannot
draw like me. No praise or blame affects me. I know my handiwork is
perfect. But there burns a truer light of God in them. Lucrezia, I
am judged."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Ah, but a man's reach should exceed his grasp,</p>
<p>Or what's a heaven for? All is silver-grey</p>
<p>Placid and perfect with my art:&mdash;the worse</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"<a name='Page158' id="Page158"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>158</span>Here," he says, "is a piece of Rafael. The arm
is out of drawing, and I could make it right. But the passion, the
soul of the thing is not in me. Had you, my love, but urged me
upward, to glory and God, I might have been uncontent; I might have
done it for you. No," and again he sweeps round on himself, out of
his excuses, "perhaps not, 'incentives come from the soul's self';
and mine is gone. I've chosen the love of you, Lucrezia, earth's
love, and I cannot pass beyond my faultless drawing into the strife
to paint those divine imaginations the soul conceives."</p>
<p>That is the meaning of Browning. The faultless, almost
mechanical art, the art which might be born of an adulterous
connection between science and art, is of little value to men. Not
in the flawless painter is true art found, but in those who painted
inadequately, yet whose pictures breathe</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Infinite passion and the pain</p>
<p>Of finite hearts that yearn.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this incessant strife to create new worlds, and in their
creation, which, always ending in partial failure, forces fresh
effort, lies, Browning might have said, the excuse for God having
deliberately made us defective. Had we been made good, had we no
strife with evil; had we the power to embody at once the beauty we
are capable of seeing; could we have laid our hand on truth, and
grasped her without the desperate struggle we have to win one fruit
from her tree; had we had no strong crying and tears, no agony
against wrong, against our own passions and their work, against
false views of things&mdash;we might have been angels; but we
<a name='Page159' id="Page159"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>159</span>should not have had humanity and all its wild
history, and all its work; we should not have had that which, for
all I know, may be unique in the universe; no, nor any of the great
results of the battle and its misery. Had it not been for the
defectiveness, the sin and pain, we should have had nothing of the
interest of the long evolution of science, law and government, of
the charm of discovery, of pursuit, of the slow upbuilding of moral
right, of the vast variety of philosophy. Above all, we should have
had none of the great art men love so well, no <i>Odyssey</i>,
<i>Divine Comedy</i> no <i>Hamlet</i>, no <i>Oedipus</i>, no
Handel, no Beethoven, no painting or sculpture where the love and
sorrow of the soul breathe in canvas, fresco, marble and bronze,
no, nor any of the great and loving lives who suffered and
overcame, from Christ to the poor woman who dies for love in a
London lane. All these are made through the struggle and the
sorrow. We should not have had, I repeat, humanity; and provided no
soul perishes for ever but lives to find union with undying love,
the game, with all its terrible sorrow, pays for the candle. We may
find out, some day, that the existence and work of humanity,
crucified as it has been, are of untold interest and use to the
universe&mdash;which things the angels desire to look into. If
Browning had listened to that view, he would, I think, have
accepted it.</p>
<p><i>Old Pictures in Florence</i> touches another side of his
theory. In itself, it is one of Browning's half-humorous poems; a
pleasantly-composed piece, glancing here and glancing there, as a
man's mind does when leaning over a hill-villa's parapet on a
<a name='Page160' id="Page160"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>160</span>sunny morning in Florence. I have elsewhere
quoted its beginning. It is a fine example of his nature-poetry: it
creates the scenery and atmosphere of the poem; and the four lines
with which the fourth verse closes sketch what Browning thought to
be one of his poetic gifts&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And mark through the winter afternoons.</p>
<p class='i2'>By a gift God grants me now and then,</p>
<p>In the mild decline of those suns like moons.</p>
<p class='i2'>Who walked in Florence, besides her men.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, then, is a poem of many moods, beginning with Giotto's
Tower; then wondering why Giotto did not tell the poet who loved
him so much that one of his pictures was lying hidden in a shop
where some one else picked it up; then, thinking of all Giotto's
followers, whose ghosts he imagines are wandering through Florence,
sorrowing for the decay of their pictures.</p>
<p>"But at least they have escaped, and have their holiday in
heaven, and do not care one straw for our praise or blame. They did
their work, they and the great masters. We call them old Masters,
but they were new in their time; their old Masters were the Greeks.
They broke away from the Greeks and revolutionised art into a new
life. In our turn we must break away from them."</p>
<p>And now glides in the theory. "When Greek art reached its
perfection, the limbs which infer the soul, and enough of the soul
to inform the limbs, were faultlessly represented. Men said the
best had been done, and aspiration and growth in art ceased.
Content with what had been done, men imitated, but did not create.
But man cannot remain without change in a past perfection; for
<a name='Page161' id="Page161"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>161</span>then he remains in a kind of death. Even with
failure, with faulty work, he desires to make new things, and in
making, to be alive and feel his life. Therefore Giotto and the
rest began to create a fresh aspect of humanity, which, however
imperfect in form, would suggest an infinite perfection. The Greek
perfection ties us down to earth, to a few forms, and the sooner,
if it forbid us to go on, we reject its ideal as the only one, the
better for art and for mankind.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'Tis a life-long toil till our lump be leaven&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'>The better! What's come to perfection perishes.</p>
<p>Things learned on earth, we shall practise in heaven:</p>
<p class='i2'>Works done least rapidly, Art most cherishes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"The great Campanile is still unfinished;" so he shapes his
thoughts into his scenery. Shall man be satisfied in art with the
crystallised joy of Apollo, or the petrified grief of Niobe, when
there are a million more expressions of joy and grief to render? In
that way felt Giotto and his crew. "We will paint the whole of
man," they cried, "paint his new hopes and joys and pains, and
never pause, because we shall never quite succeed. We will paint
the soul in all its infinite variety&mdash;bring the invisible full
into play. Of course we shall miss perfection&mdash;who can get
side by side with infinitude?&mdash;but we shall grow out of the
dead perfection of the past, and live and move, and have our
being.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Let the visible go to the dogs&mdash;what matters?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus art began again. Its spring-tide came, dim and dewy; and
the world rejoiced.</p>
<p>And that is what has happened again and again in the history of
art. Browning has painted a <a name='Page162' id=
"Page162"></a><span class='pagenum'>162</span>universal truth. It
was that which took place when Wordsworth, throwing away the
traditions of a century and all the finished perfection, as men
thought, of the Augustan age, determined to write of man as man,
whatever the issue; to live with the infinite variety of human
nature, and in its natural simplicities. What we shall see, he
thought, may be faulty, common, unideal, imperfect. What we shall
write will not have the conventional perfection of Pope and Gray,
which all the cultivated world admires, and in which it rests
content&mdash;growth and movement dead&mdash;but it will be true,
natural, alive, running onwards to a far-off goal. And we who
write&mdash;our loins are accinct, our lights burning, as men
waiting for the revelation of the Bridegroom. Wordsworth brought
back the soul to Poetry. She made her failures, but she was alive.
Spring was blossoming around her with dews and living airs, and the
infinite opened before her.</p>
<p>So, too, it was when Turner recreated landscape art. There was
the perfect Claudesque landscape, with all its parts arranged, its
colours chosen, the composition balanced, the tree here, the river
there, the figures in the foreground, the accurate distribution and
gradation of the masses of light and shade. "There," the critics
said, "we have had perfection. Let us rest in that." And all growth
in landscape-art ceased. Then came Turner, who, when he had
followed the old for a time and got its good, broke away from it,
as if in laughter. "What," he felt, "the infinite of nature is
before me; inconceivable change and variety in earth, and sky, and
sea&mdash;and shall I be tied down to one form of painting
landscape, one arrangement of <a name='Page163' id=
"Page163"></a><span class='pagenum'>163</span>artistic properties?
Let the old perfection go." And we had our revolution in landscape
art: nothing, perhaps, so faultless as Claude's composition, but
life, love of nature, and an illimitable range; incessant change,
movement, and aspiration which have never since allowed the
landscape artist to think that he has attained.</p>
<p>On another side of the art of painting, Rossetti, Millais, Hunt
arose; and they said, "We will paint men as they actually were in
the past, in the moments of their passion, and with their emotions
on their faces, and with the scenery around them as it was; and
whatever background of nature there was behind them, it shall be
painted direct from the very work of nature herself, and in her
very colours. In doing this our range will become infinite. No
doubt we shall fail. We cannot grasp the whole of nature and
humanity, but we shall be <i>in</i> their life: aspiring, alive,
and winning more and more of truth." And the world of art howled at
them, as the world of criticism howled at Wordsworth. But a new
life and joy began to move in painting. Its winter was over, its
spring had begun, its summer was imagined. Their drawing was
faulty; their colour was called crude; they seemed to know little
or nothing of composition; but the Spirit of Life was in them, and
their faults were worth more than the best successes of the school
that followed Rafael; for their faults proved that passion,
aspiration and originality were again alive:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Give these, I exhort you, their guerdon and glory</p>
<p class='i2'>For daring so much, before they well did it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>If ever the artist should say to himself, "What I <a name=
'Page164' id="Page164"></a><span class='pagenum'>164</span>desire
has been attained: I can but imitate or follow it"; or if the
people who care for any art should think, "The best has been
reached; let us be content to rest in that perfection"; the death
of art has come.</p>
<p>The next poem belonging to this subject is the second part of
<i>Pippa Passes</i>. What concerns us here is that Jules, the
French artist, loves Phene; and on his return from his marriage
pours out his soul to her concerning his art.</p>
<p>In his work, in his pursuit of beauty through his aspiration to
the old Greek ideal, he has found his full content&mdash;his heaven
upon earth. But now, living love of a woman has stolen in. How can
he now, he asks, pursue that old ideal when he has the real? how
carve Tydeus, with her about the room? He is disturbed, thrilled,
uncontent A new ideal rises. How can he now</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Bid each conception stand while, trait by trait,</p>
<p>My hand transfers its lineaments to stone?</p>
<p>Will my mere fancies live near you, their truth&mdash;</p>
<p>The live truth, passing and repassing me,</p>
<p>Sitting beside me?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Before he had seen her, all the varied stuff of Nature, every
material in her workshop, tended to one form of beauty, to the
human archetype. But now she, Phene, represents the archetype; and
though Browning does not express this, we feel that if Jules
continue in that opinion, his art will die. Then, carried away by
his enthusiasm for his art, he passes, through a statement that
nature suggests in all her doings man and his life and his
beauty&mdash;a statement Browning himself makes in
<i>Paracelsus</i>&mdash;to a description of the capabilities of
various stuffs <a name='Page165' id="Page165"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>165</span>in nature under the sculptor's hand, and
especially of marble as having in it the capabilities of all the
other stuffs and also something more a living spirit in itself
which aids the sculptor and even does some of his work.</p>
<p>This is a subtle thought peculiarly characteristic of Browning's
thinking about painting, music, poetry, or sculpture. I believe he
felt, and if he did not, it is still true, that the vehicle of any
art brought something out of itself into the work of the artist.
Abt Vogler feels this as he plays on the instrument he made. Any
musician who plays on two instruments knows that the distinct
instrument does distinct work, and loves each instrument for its
own spirit; because each makes his art, expressed in it, different
from his art expressed in another. Even the same art-creation is
different in two instruments: the vehicle does its own part of the
work. Any painter will say the same, according as he works in
fresco or on canvas, in water-colour or in oil. Even a material
like charcoal makes him work the same conception in a different
way. I will quote the passage; it goes to the root of the matter;
and whenever I read it, I seem to hear a well-known sculptor as he
talked one night to me of the spiritual way in which marble, so
soft and yet so firm, answered like living material to his tool,
sending flame into it, and then seemed, as with a voice, to welcome
the emotion which, flowing from him through the chisel, passed into
the stone.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>But of the stuffs one can be master of,</p>
<p>How I divined their capabilities!</p>
<p>From the soft-rinded smoothening facile chalk</p>
<p>That yields your outline to the air's embrace,</p>
<a name='Page166' id="Page166"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>166</p>
<p>Half-softened by a halo's pearly gloom:</p>
<p>Down to the crisp imperious steel, so sure</p>
<p>To cut its one confided thought clean out</p>
<p>Of all the world. But marble!&mdash;'neath my tools</p>
<p>More pliable than jelly&mdash;as it were</p>
<p>Some clear primordial creature dug from depths</p>
<p>In the earth's heart, where itself breeds itself.</p>
<p>And whence all baser substance may be worked;</p>
<p>Refine it off to air, you may&mdash;condense it</p>
<p>Down to the diamond;&mdash;is not metal there,</p>
<p>When o'er the sudden speck my chisel trips?</p>
<p>&mdash;Not flesh, as flake off flake I scale, approach,</p>
<p>Lay bare those bluish veins of blood asleep?</p>
<p>Lurks flame in no strange windings where, surprised</p>
<p>By the swift implement sent home at once,</p>
<p>Flushes and glowings radiate and hover</p>
<p>About its track?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But Jules finds that Phene, whom he has been deceived into
believing an intelligence equal to his own, does not understand one
word he has said, is nothing but an uneducated girl; and his dream
of perfection in the marriage of Art and Love vanishes away, and
with the deception the aims and hopes of his art as it has been.
And Browning makes this happen of set purpose, in order that,
having lost satisfaction in his art-ideal, and then his
satisfaction in that ideal realised in a woman&mdash;having failed
in Art and Love&mdash;he may pass on into a higher aim, with a
higher conception, both of art and love, and make a new world, in
the woman and in the art. He is about to accept the failure, to
take only to revenge on his deceivers, when Pippa sings as she is
passing, and the song touches him into finer issues of thought. He
sees that Phene's soul is, like a butterfly, half-loosed from its
chrysalis, and ready for flight. The sight and song awake a truer
love, for as yet he has loved Phene <a name='Page167' id=
"Page167"></a><span class='pagenum'>167</span>only through his art.
Now he is impassioned with pity for a human soul, and his first new
sculpture will be the creation of her soul.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Shall to produce form out of unshaped stuff</p>
<p>Be Art&mdash;and further, to evoke a soul</p>
<p>From form be nothing? This new soul is mine!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At last, he is borne into self-forgetfulness by love, and finds
a man's salvation. And in that loss of self he drinks of the deep
fountain of art. Aprile found that out. Sordello dies as he
discovers it, and Jules, the moment he has touched its waters with
his lip, sees a new realm of art arise, and loves it with such joy
that he knows he will have power to dwell in its heart, and create
from its joy.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>One may do whate'er one likes</p>
<p>In Art; the only thing is, to make sure</p>
<p>That one does like it&mdash;which takes pains to know.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He breaks all his models up. They are paltry, dead things
belonging to a dead past. "I begin," he cries, "art afresh, in a
fresh world,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Some unsuspected isle in far-off seas."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The ideal that fails means the birth of a new ideal. The very
centre of Browning as an artist is there:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,</p>
<p class='i2'>Sleep to wake!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sordello is another example of his theory, of a different type
from Aprile, or that poet in <i>Pauline</i> who gave Browning the
sketch from which Sordello was conceived. But Browning, who, as I
have said, repeated his theory, never repeated his examples: and
Sordello is not only clearly varied from Aprile <a name='Page168'
id="Page168"></a><span class='pagenum'>168</span>and the person in
<i>Pauline</i>, but the variations themselves are inventively
varied. The complex temperament of Sordello incessantly alters its
form, not only as he grows from youth to manhood, but as
circumstances meet him. They give him a shock, as a slight blow
does to a kaleidoscope, and the whole pattern of his mind changes.
But as with the bits of coloured glass in the kaleidoscope, the
elements of Bordello's mind remain the same. It is only towards the
end of his career, on the forcible introduction into his life of
new elements from the outward world, that his character radically
changes, and his soul is born. He wins that which he has been
without from the beginning. He wins, as we should say, a heart. He
not only begins to love Palma otherwise than in his dreams, but
with that love the love of man arises&mdash;for, in characters like
Sordello, personal love, once really stirred, is sure to expand
beyond itself&mdash;and then, following on the love of man,
conscience is quickened into life, and for the first time
recognises itself and its duties. In this new light of love and
conscience, directed towards humanity, he looks back on his life as
an artist, or rather, Browning means us to do so; and we understand
that he has done nothing worthy in his art; and that even his gift
of imagination has been without the fire of true passion. His
aspirations, his phantasies, his songs, done only for his own sake,
have been cold, and left the world cold.</p>
<p>He has aspired to a life in the realm of pure imagination, to
winning by imagination alone all knowledge and all love, and the
power over men which flows from these. He is, in this aspiration,
Paracelsus and Aprile in one. But he has neither <a name='Page169'
id="Page169"></a><span class='pagenum'>169</span>the sincerity of
Paracelsus nor the passion of Aprile. He lives in himself alone,
beyond the world of experience, and only not conscious of those
barriers which limit our life on which Browning dwells so much,
because he does not bring his aspirations or his imaginative work
to the test by shaping them outside of himself. He fails, that is,
to create anything which will please or endure; fails in the first
aim, the first duty of an artist. He comes again and again to the
verge of creating something which may give delight to men, but only
once succeeds, when by chance, in a moment of excited impulse,
caused partly by his own vanity, and partly by the waves of
humanity at Palma's <i>Court of Love</i> beating on his soul, he
breaks for a passing hour into the song which conquers Eglamor.
When, at the end, he does try to shape himself without for the sake
of men he is too late for this life. He dies of the long struggle,
of the revelation of his failure and the reasons of it, of the
supreme light which falls on his wasted life; and yet not wasted,
since even in death he has found his soul and all it means. His
imagination, formerly only intellectual, has become emotional as
well; he loves mankind, and sacrifices fame, power, and knowledge
to its welfare. He no longer thinks to avoid, by living only in
himself, the baffling limitations which inevitably trouble human
life; but now desires, working within these limits, to fix his eyes
on the ineffable Love; failing but making every failure a ladder on
which to climb to higher things. This&mdash;the true way of
life&mdash;he finds out as he dies. To have that spirit, and to
work in it, is the very life of art. To pass for ever out of and
beyond <a name='Page170' id="Page170"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>170</span>one's self is to the artist the lesson of
Bordello's story.</p>
<p>It is hardly learnt. The self in Sordello, the self of
imagination unwarned by love of men, is driven out of the artist
with strange miseries, battles and despairs, and these Browning
describes with such inventiveness that at the last one is inclined
to say, with all the pitiful irony of Christ, "This kind goeth not
forth but with prayer and fasting."</p>
<p>The position in the poem is at root the same as that in
Tennyson's <i>Palace of Art</i>. These two poets found, about the
same time, the same idea, and, independently, shaped it into poems.
Tennyson put it into the form of a vision, the defect of which was
that it was too far removed from common experience. Browning put it
into the story of a man's life. Tennyson expressed it with
extraordinary clearness, simplicity, and with a wealth of lovely
ornament, so rich that it somewhat overwhelmed the main lines of
his conception. Browning expressed it with extraordinary
complexity, subtlety, and obscurity of diction. But when we take
the trouble of getting to the bottom of <i>Sordello</i>, we find
ourselves where we do not find ourselves in <i>The Palace of
Art</i>&mdash;we find ourselves in close touch and friendship with
a man, living with him, sympathising with him, pitying him,
blessing him, angry and delighted with him, amazingly interested in
his labyrinthine way of thinking and feeling; we follow with keen
interest his education, we see a soul in progress; we wonder what
he will do next, what strange turn we shall come to in his mind,
what new effort he will make to realise himself; and, loving him
right through from his childhood to his death, we are <a name=
'Page171' id="Page171"></a><span class='pagenum'>171</span>quite
satisfied when he dies. At the back of this, and complicating it
still more&mdash;but, when we arrive at seeing it clearly,
increasing the interest of the poem&mdash;is a great to-and-fro of
humanity at a time when humanity was alive and keen and full of
attempting; when men were savagely original, when life was lived to
its last drop, and when a new world was dawning. Of all this
outside humanity there is not a trace in Tennyson, and Browning
could not have got on without it. Of course, it made his poetry
difficult. We cannot get excellences without their attendant
defects. We have a great deal to forgive in <i>Sordello</i>. But
for the sake of the vivid humanity we forgive it all.</p>
<p>Sordello begins as a boy, living alone in a castle near Mantua,
built in a gorge of the low hills, and the description of the
scenery of the castle, without and within, is one example of the
fine ornament of which <i>Sordello</i> is so full. There, this rich
and fertile nature lives, fit to receive delight at every sense,
fit to shape what is received into imaginative pictures within, but
not without; content with the contemplation of his own imaginings.
At first it is Nature from whom Sordello receives impressions, and
he amuses himself with the fancies he draws from her. But he never
shapes his emotion into actual song. Then tired of Nature, he
dreams himself into the skin and soul of all the great men of whom
he has read. He becomes them in himself, as Pauline's lover has
done before him; but one by one they fade into unreality&mdash;for
he knows nothing of men&mdash;and the last projection of himself
into Apollo, the Lord of Poetry, is the most unreal of them all: at
which fantasy all the woods and <a name='Page172' id=
"Page172"></a><span class='pagenum'>172</span>streams and sunshine
round Goito are infinitely amused. Thus, when he wants sympathy, he
does not go down to Mantua and make song for the crowd of men; he
invents in dreams a host of sympathisers, all of whom are but
himself in other forms. Even when he aims at perfection, and,
making himself Apollo, longs for a Daphne to double his life, his
soul is still such stuff as dreams are made of, till he wakes one
morning to ask himself: "When will this dream be truth?"</p>
<p>This is the artist's temperament in youth when he is not
possessed of the greater qualities of genius&mdash;his imaginative
visions, his aspirations, his pride in apartness from men, his
self-contentment, his sloth, the presence in him of barren
imagination, the absence from it of the spiritual, nothing in him
which as yet desires, through the sorrow and strife of life, God's
infinitude, or man's love; a natural life indeed, forgiveable, gay,
sportive, dowered with happy self-love, good to pass through and
enjoy, but better to leave behind. But Sordello will not become the
actual artist till he lose his self-involvement and find his soul,
not only in love of his Daphne but in love of man. And the first
thing he will have to do is that which Sordello does not care to
do&mdash;to embody before men in order to give them pleasure or
impulse, to console or exalt them, some of the imaginations he has
enjoyed within himself. Nor can Sordello's imagination reach true
passion, for it ignores that which chiefly makes the artist; union
with the passions of mankind. Only when near to death does he
outgrow the boy of Goito, and then we find that he has ceased to be
the artist. Thus, the poem is the <a name='Page173' id=
"Page173"></a><span class='pagenum'>173</span>history of the
failure of a man with an artistic temperament to be an artist. Or
rather, that is part of the story of the poem, and, as Browning was
an artist himself, a part which is of the greatest interest.</p>
<p>Sordello, at the close of the first book, is wearied of dreams.
Even in his solitude, the limits of life begin to oppress him. Time
fleets, fate is tardy, life will be over before he lives. Then an
accident helps him&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Which breaking on Sordello's mixed content</p>
<p>Opened, like any flash that cures the blind,</p>
<p>The veritable business of mankind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This accident is the theme of the second book. It belongs to the
subject of this chapter, for it contrasts two types of the artist,
Eglamor and Sordello, and it introduces Naddo, the critic, with a
good knowledge of poetry, with a great deal of common sense, with
an inevitable sliding into the opinion that what society has
stamped must be good&mdash;a mixed personage, and a sketch done
with Browning's humorous and pitying skill.</p>
<p>The contrast between Eglamor and Sordello runs through the whole
poem. Sordello recalls Eglamor at the last, and Naddo appears again
and again to give the worldly as well as the common-sense solution
of the problems which Sordello makes for himself. Eglamor is the
poet who has no genius, whom one touch of genius burns into
nothing, but who, having a charming talent, employs it well; and
who is so far the artist that what he feels he is able to shape
gracefully, and to please mankind therewith; who, moreover loves,
enjoys, and is <a name='Page174' id="Page174"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>174</span>wholly possessed with what he shapes in song.
This is good; but then he is quite satisfied with what he does; he
has no aspiration, and all the infinitude of beauty is lost to him.
And when Sordello takes up his incomplete song, finishes it,
inspires, expands what Eglamor thought perfect, he sees at last
that he has only a graceful talent, that he has lived in a vain
show, like a gnome in a cell of the rock of gold. Genius,
momentarily realising itself in Sordello, reveals itself to Eglamor
with all its infinities; Heaven and Earth and the universe open on
Eglamor, and the revelation of what he is, and of the perfection
beyond, kills him. That is a fine, true, and piteous sketch.</p>
<p>But Sordello, who is the man of possible genius, is not much
better off. There has been one outbreak into reality at Palma's
<i>Court of Love</i>. Every one, afterwards, urges him to sing. The
critics gather round him. He makes poems, he becomes the accepted
poet of Northern Italy. But he cannot give continuous delight to
the world. His poems are not like his song before Palma. They have
no true passion, being woven like a spider's web out of his own
inside. His case then is more pitiable, his failure more complete,
than Eglamor's. Eglamor could shape something; he had his own
enjoyment, and he gave pleasure to men. Sordello, lured incessantly
towards abstract ideals, lost in their contemplation, is smitten,
like Aprile, into helplessness by the multitudinousness of the
images he sees, refuses to descend into real life and submit to its
limitations, is driven into the slothfulness of that dreaming
imagination which is powerless to embody its images in the actual
song. Sometimes <a name='Page175' id="Page175"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>175</span>he tries to express himself, longing for
reality. When he tries he fails, and instead of making failure a
step to higher effort, he falls back impatiently on himself, and is
lost in himself. Moreover, he tries always within himself, and with
himself for judge. He does not try the only thing which would help
him&mdash;the submission of his work to the sympathy and judgment
of men. Out of touch with any love save love of his own imaginings,
he cannot receive those human impressions which kindle the artist
into work, nor answer the cry which comes from mankind, with such
eagerness, to genius&mdash;"Express for us in clear form that which
we vaguely feel. Make us see and admire and love." Then he ceases
even to love song, because, though he can imagine everything, he
can do nothing; and deaf to the voices of men, he despises man.
Finally he asks himself, like so many young poets who have followed
his way, What is the judgment of the world worth? Nothing at all,
he answers. With that ultimate folly, the favourite resort of minor
poets, Sordello goes altogether wrong. He pleases nobody, not even
himself; spends his time in arguing inside himself why he has not
succeeded; and comes to no conclusion, except that total failure is
the necessity of the world. At last one day, wandering from Mantua,
he finds himself in his old environment, in the mountain cup where
Goito and the castle lie. And the old dream, awakened by the old
associations, that he was Apollo, Lord of Song, rushed back upon
him and enwrapped him wholly. He feels, in the blessed silence,
that he is no longer what he has been of late,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page176' id="Page176"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>176</p>
<p class='i12'>a pettish minstrel meant</p>
<p>To wear away his soul in discontent,</p>
<p>Brooding on fortune's malice,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but himself once more, freed from the world of Mantua; alone
again, but in his loneliness really more lost than he was at
Mantua, as we soon find out in the third book.</p>
<p>I return, in concluding this chapter, to the point which bears
most clearly on Browning as the poet of art. The only time when
Sordello realises what it is to be an artist is when, swept out of
himself by the kindled emotion of the crowd at the <i>Court of
Love</i> and inspired also by the true emotion of Eglamor's song,
which has been made because he loved it&mdash;his imagination is
impassioned enough to shape for man the thing within him, outside
of himself, and to sing for the joy of singing&mdash;having
forgotten himself in mankind, in their joy and in his own.</p>
<p>But it was little good to him. When he stole home to Goito in a
dream, he sat down to think over the transport he had felt, why he
felt it, how he was better than Eglamor; and at last, having missed
the whole use of the experience (which was to draw him into the
service of man within the limits of life but to always transcend
the limits in aspiration), he falls away from humanity into his own
self again; and perfectly happy for the moment, but lost as an
artist and a man, lies lazy, filleted and robed on the turf, with a
lute beside him, looking over the landscape below the castle and
fancying himself Apollo. This is to have the capacity to be an
artist, but it is not to be an artist. And we leave Sordello lying
on the grass enjoying himself, but not destined on that account to
give any joy to man.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3><i>SORDELLO</i></h3>
<p>The period in which the poem of <i>Sordello</i> opens is at the
end of the first quarter of the thirteenth century, at the time
when the Guelf cities allied themselves against the Ghibellines in
Northern Italy. They formed the Lombard League, and took their
private quarrels up into one great quarrel&mdash;that between the
partisans of the Empire and those of the Pope. Sordello is then a
young man of thirty years. He was born in 1194, when the fierce
fight in the streets of Vicenza took place which Salinguerra
describes, as he looks back on his life, in the fourth canto of
this poem. The child is saved in that battle, and brought from
Vicenza by Adelaide, the second wife of Ezzelino da Romano
II.,<a name='FNanchor_8_8' id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href=
'#Footnote_8_8'>[8]</a> to Goito. He is really the son of
Salinguerra and Retrude, a connection of Frederick II., but
Adelaide conceals this, and brings him up as her page, alleging
that he is the son of Elcorte, an archer. Palma (or Cunizza),
Ezzelino's daughter by Agnes Este, his first wife, is also at Goito
in attendance on Adelaide. Sordello and she meet as girl and boy,
and she becomes one of the <a name='Page178' id=
"Page178"></a><span class='pagenum'>178</span>dreams with which his
lonely youth at Goito is adorned.</p>
<p>At Adelaide's death Palma discovers the real birth of Sordello.
She has heard him sing some time before at a Love-court, where he
won the prize; where she, admiring, began to love him; and this
love of hers has been increased by his poetic fame which has now
filled North Italy. She summons him to her side at Verona, makes
him understand that she loves him, and urges him, as Salinguerra's
son, to take the side of the Ghibellines to whose cause
Salinguerra, the strongest military adventurer in North Italy, has
now devoted himself. When the poem begins, Salinguerra has received
from the Emperor the badge which gives him the leadership of the
Ghibelline party in North Italy.</p>
<p>Then Palma, bringing Sordello to see Salinguerra, reveals to the
great partisan that Sordello is his son, and that she loves him.
Salinguerra, seeing in the union of Palma, daughter of the Lord of
Romano, with his son, a vital source of strength to the Emperor's
party, throws the Emperor's badge on his son's neck, and offers him
the leadership of the Ghibellines. Palma urges him to accept it;
but Sordello has been already convinced that the Guelf side is the
right one to take for the sake of mankind. Rome, he thinks, is the
great uniting power; only by Rome can the cause of peace and the
happiness of the people be in the end secured. That cause&mdash;the
cause of a happy people&mdash;is the one thing for which, after
many dreams centred in self, Sordello has come to care. He is
sorely tempted by the love of Palma and by the power <a name=
'Page179' id="Page179"></a><span class='pagenum'>179</span>offered
him to give up that cause or to palter with it; yet in the end his
soul resists the temptation. But the part of his life, in which he
has neglected his body, has left him without physical strength; and
now the struggle of his soul to do right in this spiritual crisis
gives the last blow to his weakened frame. His heart breaks, and he
dies at the moment when he dimly sees the true goal of life. This
is a masterpiece of the irony of the Fate-Goddess; and a faint
suspicion of this irony, underlying life, even though Browning
turns it round into final good, runs in and out of the whole poem
in a winding thread of thought.</p>
<p>This is the historical background of the poem, and in front of
it are represented Sordello, his life, his development as an
individual soul, and his death. I have, from one point of view,
slightly analysed the first two books of the poem, but to analyse
the whole would be apart from the purpose of this book. My object
in this and the following chapter is to mark out, with here and
there a piece of explanation, certain characteristics of the poem
in relation, first, to the time in which it is placed; secondly, to
the development of Sordello in contact with that time; and thirdly,
to our own time; then to trace the connection of the poem with the
poetic evolution of Browning; and finally, to dwell throughout the
whole discussion on its poetic qualities.</p>
<p>1. The time in which the poem's thought and action are placed is
the beginning of the thirteenth century in North Italy, a period in
which the religious basis of life, laid so enthusiastically in the
eleventh century, and gradually weakening through the twelfth, had
all but faded away for the medi&aelig;val <a name='Page180' id=
"Page180"></a><span class='pagenum'>180</span>noble and burgher,
and even for the clergy. Religion, it is true, was confessed and
its dogmas believed in; the Cistercian revival had restored some of
its lost influence, but it did not any longer restrain the
passions, modify the wickedness, control the ambitions or subdue
the world, in the heart of men, as it had done in the eleventh
century. There was in Italy, at least, an unbridled licence of
life, a fierce individuality, which the existence of a number of
small republics encouraged; and, in consequence, a wild confusion
of thought and act in every sphere of human life. Moreover, all
through the twelfth century there had been a reaction among the
artistic and literary men against the theory of life laid down by
the monks, and against the merely saintly aims and practice of the
religious, of which that famous passage in <i>Aucassin and
Nicolete</i> is an embodiment. Then, too, the love poetry (a poetry
which tended to throw monkish purity aside) started in the midst of
the twelfth century; then the troubadours began to sing; and then
the love-songs of Germany arose. And Italian poetry, a poetry which
tended to repel the religion of the spirit for the religion of
enjoyment, had begun in Sicily and Siena in 1172-78, and was
nurtured in the Sicilian Court of Frederick II., while Sordello was
a youth. All over Europe, poetry drifted into a secular poetry of
love and war and romance. The religious basis of life had lost its
strength. As to North Italy, where our concern lies, humanity there
was weltering like a sea, tossing up and down, with no direction in
its waves. It was not till Francis of Assisi came that a new
foundation for religious life, a new direction for it, began to be
established. As to <a name='Page181' id="Page181"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>181</span>Law, Government, Literature, and Art, all their
elements were in equal confusion. Every noble, every warrior who
reached ascendency, or was born to it, made his own laws and
governed as he liked. Every little city had its own fashions and
its own aims; and was continually fighting, driven by jealousy,
envy, hatred, or emulation, with its neighbours. War was the
incessant business of life, and was carried on not only against
neighbouring cities, but by each city in its own streets, from its
own towers, where noble fought against noble, citizen with citizen,
and servant with servant. Literature was only trying to begin, to
find its form, to find its own Italian tongue, to understand what
it desired. It took more than a century after Sordello's youth to
shape itself into the poetry of Dante and Petrarch, into their
prose and the prose of Boccaccio. The <i>Vita Nuova</i> was set
forth in 1290, 93, the <i>Decameron</i> in 1350, 53, and Petrarch
was crowned at Rome in 1341. And the arts of sculpture and painting
were in the same condition. They were struggling towards a new
utterance, but as yet they could not speak.</p>
<p>It is during this period of impassioned confusion and struggle
towards form, during this carnival of individuality, that Sordello,
as conceived by Browning, a modern in the midst of
medi&aelig;valism, an exceptional character wholly unfitted for the
time, is placed by Browning. And the clash between himself and his
age is too much for him. He dies of it; dies of the striving to
find an anchorage for life, and of his inability to find it in this
chartless sea. But the world of men, incessantly recruited by new
generations, does not die like the individual, <a name='Page182'
id="Page182"></a><span class='pagenum'>182</span>and what Sordello
could not do, it did. It emerged from this confusion in the
thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, with S. Francis, Dante,
Petrarch and Boccaccio, the Pisani, Giotto, and the Commonwealth of
Florence. Religion, Poetry, Prose, Sculpture, Painting, Government
and Law found new foundations. The Renaissance began to dawn, and
during its dawn kept, among the elect of mankind, all or nearly all
the noble impulses and faith of medi&aelig;valism.</p>
<p>This dawn of the Renaissance is nearly a hundred years away at
the time of this poem, yet two of its characteristics vitally moved
through this transition period; and, indeed, while they continued
even to the end of the Renaissance, were powers which brought it
about. The first of these was a boundless curiosity about life, and
the second was an intense individuality. No one can read the
history of the Italian Republics in the thirteenth century without
incessantly coming into contact with both these elements working
fiercely, confusedly, without apparently either impulse or aim, but
producing a wonderful activity of life, out of which, by command as
it were of the gods, a new-created world might rise into order. It
was as if chaos were stirred, like a cauldron with a stick, that
suns and planets, moving by living law, might emerge in beauty.
Sordello lived in the first whirling of these undigested elements,
and could only dream of what might be; but it was life in which he
moved, disorderly life, it is true, but not the dread disorder of
decay. Browning paints it with delight.</p>
<p>This unbridled curiosity working in men of un<a name='Page183'
id="Page183"></a><span class='pagenum'>183</span>bridled
individuality produced a tumbling confusion in life. Men, full of
eagerness, each determined to fulfil his own will, tried every kind
of life, attempted every kind of pursuit, strove to experience all
the passions, indulged their passing impulses to the full, and when
they were wearied of any experiment in living passed on to the
next, not with weariness but with fresh excitement. Cities, small
republics, did the same collectively&mdash;Ferrara, Padua, Verona,
Mantua, Milan, Parma, Florence, Pisa, Siena, Perugia. Both cities
and citizens lived in a nervous storm, and at every impulse passed
into furious activity. In five minutes a whole town was up in the
market-place, the bells rang, the town banner was displayed, and in
an hour the citizens were marching out of the gates to attack the
neighbouring city. A single gibe in the streets, or at the church
door, interchanged between one noble and another of opposite
factions, and the gutters of the streets ran red with the blood of
a hundred men. This then was the time of <i>Sordello</i>, and
splendidly has Browning represented it.</p>
<p>2. Sordello is the image of this curiosity and individuality,
but only inwardly. In the midst of this turbulent society Browning
creates him with the temperament of a poet, living in a solitary
youth, apart from arms and the wild movement of the world. His soul
is full of the curiosity of the time. The inquisition of his whole
life is, "What is the life most worth living? How shall I attain
it, in what way make it mine?" and then, "What sort of lives are
lived by other men?" and, finally, "What is the happiest life for
the whole?" The curiosity does not drive him, like the rest of the
<a name='Page184' id="Page184"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>184</span>world, into action in the world. It expands
only in thought and dreaming. But however he may dream, however
wrapt in self he may be, his curiosity about these matters never
lessens for a moment. Even in death it is his ruling passion.</p>
<p>Along with this he shares fully in the impassioned individuality
of the time. Browning brings that forward continually. All the
dreams of his youth centre in himself; Nature becomes the
reflection of himself; all histories of great men he represents as
in himself; finally, he becomes to himself Apollo, the incarnation
of poetry. But he does not seek to realise his individuality, any
more than his curiosity, in action. When he is drawn out of himself
at Mantua and sings for a time to please men, he finds that the
public do not understand him, and flies back to his solitude, back
to his own soul. And Mantua, and love, and adventure all die within
him. "I have all humanity," he says, "within myself&mdash;why then
should I seek humanity?" This is the way the age's passion for
individuality shows itself in him. Other men put it into love, war,
or adventure. He does not; he puts it into the lonely building-up
of his own soul. Even when he is brought into the midst of the
action of the time we see that he is apart from it. As he wanders
through the turmoil of the streets of Ferrara in Book iv., he is
dreaming still of his own life, of his own soul. His curiosity,
wars and adventures are within. The various lives he is anxious to
live are lived in lonely imaginations. The individuality he
realises is in thought. At this point then he is apart from his
century&mdash;an exceptional temperament set in strong contrast to
<a name='Page185' id="Page185"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>185</span>the world around him&mdash;the dreamer face to
face with a mass of men all acting with intensity. And the common
result takes place; the exceptional breaks down against the steady
and terrible pull of the ordinary. It is Hamlet over again, and
when Sordello does act it is just as Hamlet does, by a sudden
impulse which lifts him from dreaming into momentary action, out of
which, almost before he has realised he is acting, he slips back
again into dreams. And his action seems to him the dream, and his
dream the activity. That saying of Hamlet's would be easy on the
lips of Sordello, if we take "bad dreams" to mean for him what they
meant for Hamlet the moment he is forced to action in the real
world&mdash;"I could be bounded in a nut-shell and think myself
king of infinite space, had I not bad dreams." When he is surprised
into action at the Court of Love at Mantua, and wins the prize of
song, he seems to slip back into a sleepy cloud. But Palma, bending
her beautiful face over him and giving him her scarf, wins him to
stay at Mantua; and for a short time he becomes the famous poet.
But he is disappointed. That which he felt himself to be (the
supernal greatness of his individuality) is not recognised, and at
last he feels that to act and fight his way through a world which
appreciates his isolated greatness so little as to dare to
criticise him, is impossible. We have seen in the last chapter how
he slips back to Goito, to his contemplation of himself in nature,
to his self-communion, to the dreams which do not contradict his
opinion of himself. The momentary creator perishes in the dreamer.
He gives up life, adventure, love, war, and he finally surrenders
his art. No more poetry for him.</p>
<p><a name='Page186' id="Page186"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>186</span>It is thus that a character feeble for action,
but mystic in imagination, acts in the petulance of youth when it
is pushed into a clashing, claiming world. In this mood a year
passes by in vague content. Yet a little grain of conscience makes
him sour. He is vexed that his youth is gone with all its promised
glow, pleasure and action; and the vexation is suddenly deepened by
seeing a great change in the aspect of nature. "What," he thinks,
when he sees the whole valley filled with Mincio in flood, "can
Nature in this way renew her youth, and not I? Alas! I cannot so
renew myself; youth is over." But if youth be dead, manhood
remains; and the curiosity and individuality of the age stir in him
again. "I must find," he thinks, "the fitting kind of life. I must
make men feel what I am. But how; what do I want for this? I want
some outward power to draw me forth and upward, as the moon draws
the waters; to lead me to a life in which I may know mankind, in
order that I may take out of men all I need to make <i>myself</i>
into perfect form&mdash;a full poet, able to impose my genius on
mankind, and to lead them where I will. What force can draw me out
of these dreaming solitudes in which I fail to realise my art? Why,
there is none so great as love. Palma who smiled on me, she shall
be my moon." At that moment, when he is again thrilled with
curiosity concerning life, again desirous to realise his
individuality in the world of men, a message comes from Palma.
"Come, there is much for you to do&mdash;come to me at Verona." She
lays a political career before him. "Take the Kaiser's cause, you
and I together; build a new Italy under the Emperor." And Sordello
is fired <a name='Page187' id="Page187"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>187</span>by the thought, not as yet for the sake of
doing good to man, but to satisfy his curiosity in a new life, and
to edify his individual soul into a perfection unattained as yet.
"I will go," he thinks, "and be the spirit in this body of mankind,
wield, animate, and shape the people of Italy, make them the form
in which I shall express myself. It is not enough to act, in
imagination, all that man is, as I have done. I will now make men
act by the force of my spirit: North Italy shall be my body, and
thus I shall realise myself"&mdash;as if one could, with that
self-contemplating motive, ever realise personality.</p>
<p>This, then, is the position of Sordello in the period of history
I have pictured, and it carries him to the end of the third book of
the poem. It has embodied the history of his youth&mdash;of his
first contact with the world; of his retreat from it into thought
over what he has gone through; and of his reawakening into a fresh
questioning&mdash;how he shall realise life, how manifest himself
in action. "What shall I do as a poet, and a man?"</p>
<p>3. The next thing to be said of <i>Sordello</i> is its vivid
realisation of certain aspects of medi&aelig;val life. Behind this
image of the curious dreamer lost in abstractions, and vividly
contrasted with it, is the fierce activity of medi&aelig;val cities
and men in incessant war; each city, each man eager to make his own
individuality supreme; and this is painted by Browning at the very
moment when the two great parties were formed, and added to
personal war the intensifying power of two ideals. This was a field
for imagination in which Browning was sure to revel, like a wild
creature of the woods on a summer day. He had the genius of places,
of portraiture, and of <a name='Page188' id=
"Page188"></a><span class='pagenum'>188</span>sudden flashes of
action and passion; and the time of which he wrote supplied him
with full matter for these several capacities of genius.</p>
<p>When we read in <i>Sordello</i> of the fierce outbursts of war
in the cities of North Italy, we know that Browning saw them with
his eyes and shared their fury and delight. Verona is painted in
the first book just as the news arrives that her prince is captive
in Ferrara. It is evening, a still and flaming sunset, and soft
sky. In dreadful contrast to this burning silence of Nature is the
wrath and hate which are seething in the market-place. Group talked
with restless group, and not a face</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>But wrath made livid, for among them were</p>
<p>Death's staunch purveyors, such as have in care</p>
<p>To feast him. Fear had long since taken root</p>
<p>In every breast, and now these crushed its fruit,</p>
<p>The ripe hate, like a wine; to note the way</p>
<p>It worked while each grew drunk! Men grave and grey</p>
<p>Stood, with shut eyelids, rocking to and fro,</p>
<p>Letting the silent luxury trickle slow</p>
<p>About the hollows where a heart should be;</p>
<p>But the young gulped with a delirious glee</p>
<p>Some foretaste of their first debauch in blood</p>
<p>At the fierce news.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Step by step the varying passions, varying with the men of the
varied cities of the League assembled at Verona, are smitten out on
the anvil of Browning's imagination. Better still is the
continuation of the same scene in the third book, when the night
has come, and the raging of the people, reaching its height,
declares war. Palma and Sordello, who are in the palace looking on
the square, lean out to see and hear. On the black balcony beneath
them, in the still air, amid a gush <a name='Page189' id=
"Page189"></a><span class='pagenum'>189</span>of torch-fire, the
grey-haired counsellors harangue the people;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>then</p>
<p>Sea-like that people surging to and fro</p>
<p>Shouted, "Hale forth the carroch&mdash;trumpets, ho,</p>
<p>A flourish! Run it in the ancient grooves!</p>
<p>Back from the bell! Hammer&mdash;that whom behoves</p>
<p>May hear the League is up!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then who will may read the dazzling account of the streets of
Ferrara thick with corpses; of Padua, of Bassano streaming blood;
of the wells chokeful of carrion, of him who catches in his spur,
as he is kicking his feet when he sits on the well and singing, his
own mother's face by the grey hair; of the sack of Vicenza in the
fourth book; of the procession of the envoys of the League through
the streets of Ferrara, with ensigns, war-cars and clanging bells;
of the wandering of Sordello at night through the squares blazing
with fires, and the soldiers camped around them singing and
shouting; of his solitary silent thinking contrasted with their
noise and action&mdash;and he who reads will know, as if he lived
in them, the fierce Italian towns of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Nor is his power less when he describes the solitary silent
places of medi&aelig;val castles, palaces, and their rooms; of the
long, statue-haunted, cypress-avenued gardens, a waste of flowers
and wild undergrowth. We wander, room by room, through Adelaide's
castle at Goito, we see every beam in the ceiling, every figure on
the tapestry; we walk with Browning through the dark passages into
the dim-lighted chambers of the town palace at Verona, and hang
over its balconies; we know the gardens at <a name='Page190' id=
"Page190"></a><span class='pagenum'>190</span>Goito, and the lonely
woods; and we keep pace with Sordello through those desolate paths
and ilex-groves, past the fountains lost in the wilderness of
foliage, climbing from terrace to terrace where the broken statues,
swarming with wasps, gleam among the leering aloes and the
undergrowth, in the garden that Salinguerra made for his Sicilian
wife at Ferrara. The words seem as it were to flare the ancient
places out before the eyes.</p>
<p>Mixed up with all this painting of towns, castles and gardens
there is some natural description. Browning endeavours, it is
plain, to keep that within the medi&aelig;val sentiment. But that
he should succeed in that was impossible. The medi&aelig;val folk
had little of our specialised sentiment for landscape, and Browning
could not get rid of it.</p>
<p>The modern philosophies of Nature do not, however, appear in
<i>Sordello</i> as they did in <i>Pauline</i> or <i>Paracelsus</i>.
Only once in the whole of <i>Sordello</i> is Nature conceived as in
analogy with man, and Browning says this in a parenthesis. "Life is
in the tempest," he cries, "thought</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Clothes the keen hill-top; mid-day woods are fraught</p>
<p>With fervours":</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>but, in spite of the medi&aelig;val environment, the modern way
of seeing Nature enters into all his descriptions. They are none
the worse for it, and do not jar too much with the medi&aelig;val
<i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>. We expect our modern sentiment, and
Sordello himself, being in many ways a modern, seems to license
these descriptions. Most of them also occur when he is on the
canvas, and are a background to his thought. Moreover, they are
<a name='Page191' id="Page191"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>191</span>not set descriptions; they are flashed out, as
it were, in a few lines, as if they came by chance, and are not
pursued into detail. Indeed, they are not done so much for the love
of Nature herself, as for passing illustrations of Sordello's ways
of thought and feeling upon matters which are not Nature. As such,
even in a medi&aelig;val poem, they are excusable. And vivid they
are in colour, in light, in reality. Some I have already isolated.
Here are a few more, just to show his hand. This is the castle and
its scenery, described in Book i.:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>In Mantua territory half is slough,</p>
<p>Half pine-tree forest: maples, scarlet oaks</p>
<p>Breed o'er the river-beds; even Mincio chokes</p>
<p>With sand the summer through: but 'tis morass</p>
<p>In winter up to Mantua's walls. There was,</p>
<p>Some thirty years before this evening's coil,</p>
<p>One spot reclaimed from the surrounding spoil,</p>
<p>Goito; just a castle built amid</p>
<p>A few low mountains; firs and larches hid</p>
<p>Their main defiles, and rings of vineyard bound</p>
<p>The rest. Some captured creature in a pound,</p>
<p>Whose artless wonder quite precludes distress,</p>
<p>Secure beside in its own loveliness,</p>
<p>So peered, with airy head, below, above</p>
<p>The castle at its toils, the lapwings love</p>
<p>To glean among at grape time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And this is the same place from the second book:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>And thus he wandered, dumb</p>
<p>Till evening, when he paused, thoroughly spent</p>
<p>On a blind hill-top: down the gorge he went,</p>
<p>Yielding himself up as to an embrace.</p>
<p>The moon came out; like features of a face,</p>
<p>A querulous fraternity of pines,</p>
<p>Sad blackthorn clumps, leafless and grovelling vines</p>
<p>Also came out, made gradually up</p>
<p>The picture; 'twas Goito's mountain-cup</p>
<p>And castle.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page192' id="Page192"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>192</span>And here, from Book iii., is Spring when Palma,
dreaming of the man she can love, cries that the waking earth is in
a thrill to welcome him&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>"Waits he not the waking year?</p>
<p>His almond-blossoms must be honey-ripe</p>
<p>By this; to welcome him fresh runnels stripe</p>
<p>The thawed ravines; because of him the wind</p>
<p>Walks like a herald."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is May from Book ii.; and afterwards, in the third book,
the months from Spring to Summer&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>My own month came;</p>
<p>'Twas a sunrise of blossoming and May.</p>
<p>Beneath a flowering laurel thicket lay</p>
<p>Sordello; each new sprinkle of white stars</p>
<p>That smell fainter of wine than Massic jars</p>
<p>Dug up at Bai&aelig;, when the south wind shed</p>
<p>The ripest, made him happier.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Not any strollings now at even-close</p>
<p>Down the field path, Sordello! by thorn-rows</p>
<p>Alive with lamp-flies, swimming spots of fire</p>
<p>And dew, outlining the black cypress-spire</p>
<p>She waits you at, Elys, who heard you first</p>
<p>Woo her, the snow month through, but, ere she durst</p>
<p>Answer 'twas April. Linden-flower-time long</p>
<p>Her eyes were on the ground; 'tis July, strong</p>
<p>Now; and, because white dust-clouds overwhelm</p>
<p>The woodside, here, or by the village elm</p>
<p>That holds the moon, she meets you, somewhat pale.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And here are two pieces of the morning, one of the wide valley
of Naples; another with which the poem ends, pure modern, for it
does not belong to Sordello's time, but to our own century. This is
from the fourth book.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Broke</p>
<p>Morning o'er earth; he yearned for all it woke&mdash;</p>
<p>From the volcano's vapour-flag, winds hoist</p>
<p>Black o'er the spread of sea,&mdash;down to the moist</p>
<p>Dale's silken barley-spikes sullied with rain,</p>
<p>Swayed earthwards, heavily to rise again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page193' id="Page193"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>193</span>And this from the last book&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Lo, on a heathy brown and nameless hill</p>
<p>By sparkling Asolo, in mist and chill,</p>
<p>Morning just up, higher and higher runs</p>
<p>A child barefoot and rosy. See! the sun's</p>
<p>On the square castle's inner-court's low wall</p>
<p>Like the chine of some extinct animal</p>
<p>Half-turned to earth and flowers; and through the haze,</p>
<p>(Save where some slender patches of grey maize</p>
<p>Are to be over-leaped) that boy has crossed</p>
<p>The whole hill-side of dew and powder-frost</p>
<p>Matting the balm and mountain camomile.</p>
<p>Up and up goes he, singing all the while</p>
<p>Some unintelligible words to beat</p>
<p>The lark, God's poet, swooning at his feet.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As alive, and even clearer in outline than these natural
descriptions, are the portraits in <i>Sordello</i> of the people of
the time. No one can mistake them for modern folk. I do not speak
of the portrait of Sordello&mdash;that is chiefly of the soul, not
of the body&mdash;but of the personages who fill the background,
the heads of noble houses, the warriors, priests, soldiers,
singers, the women, and chiefly Adelaide and Palma. These stand
before us as Tintoret or Veronese might have painted them had they
lived on into the great portrait-century. Their dress, their
attitudes, their sudden gestures, their eyes, hair, the trick of
their mouths, their armour, how they walked and talked and read and
wrote, are all done in quick touches and jets of colour. Each is
distinct from the others, each a type. A multitude of cabinet
sketches of men are made in the market-places, in castle rooms, on
the roads, in the gardens, on the bastions of the towns. Take as
one example the Pope's Legate:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page194' id="Page194"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>194</p>
<p>With eyes, like fresh-blown thrush-eggs on a thread,</p>
<p>Faint-blue and loosely floating in his head,</p>
<p>Large tongue, moist open mouth; and this long while</p>
<p>That owner of the idiotic smile</p>
<p>Serves them!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nor does Browning confine himself to personages of Sordello's
time. There are admirable portraits, but somewhat troubled by
unnecessary matter, of Dante, of Charlemagne, of Hildebrand. One
elaborate portrait is continued throughout the poem. It is that of
Salinguerra, the man of action as contrasted with Sordello the
dreamer. Much pains are spent on this by Browning. We see him first
in the streets of Ferrara.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Men understood</p>
<p>Living was pleasant to him as he wore</p>
<p>His careless surcoat, glanced some missive o'er,</p>
<p>Propped on his truncheon in the public way.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then at the games at Mantua, when he is told Sordello will not
come to sing a welcome to him. What cares he for poet's whims?</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The easy-natured soldier smiled assent,</p>
<p>Settled his portly person, smoothed his chin,</p>
<p>And nodded that the bull-bait might begin.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then mad with fighting frenzy in the sacking of Vicenza, then in
his palace nursing his scheme to make the Emperor predominant, then
pacing like a lion, hot with hope of mastering all Italy, when he
finds out that Sordello is his son: "hands clenched, head erect,
pursuing his discourse&mdash;crimson ear, eyeballs suffused,
temples full fraught."</p>
<p>Then in the fourth book there is a long portrait of him which I
quote as a full specimen of the power with which Browning could
paint a partisan <a name='Page195' id="Page195"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>195</span>of the thirteenth century. Though sixty years
old, Salinguerra looked like a youth&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>So agile, quick</p>
<p>And graceful turned the head on the broad chest</p>
<p>Encased in pliant steel, his constant vest,</p>
<p>Whence split the sun off in a spray of fire</p>
<p>Across the room; and, loosened of its tire</p>
<p>Of steel, that head let breathe the comely brown</p>
<p>Large massive locks discoloured as if a crown</p>
<p>Encircled them, so frayed the basnet where</p>
<p>A sharp white line divided clean the hair;</p>
<p>Glossy above, glossy below, it swept</p>
<p>Curling and fine about a brow thus kept</p>
<p>Calm, laid coat upon coat, marble and sound:</p>
<p>This was the mystic mark the Tuscan found,</p>
<p>Mused of, turned over books about. Square-faced,</p>
<p>No lion more; two vivid eyes, enchased</p>
<p>In hollows filled with many a shade and streak</p>
<p>Settling from the bold nose and bearded cheek.</p>
<p>Nor might the half-smile reach them that deformed</p>
<p>A lip supremely perfect else&mdash;unwarmed,</p>
<p>Unwidened, less or more; indifferent</p>
<p>Whether on trees or men his thoughts were bent,</p>
<p>Thoughts rarely, after all, in trim and train</p>
<p>As now a period was fulfilled again:</p>
<p>Of such, a series made his life, compressed</p>
<p>In each, one story serving for the rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is one example of a gallery of vivid portraiture in all
Browning's work, such as Carlyle only in the nineteenth century has
approached in England. It is not a national, but an international
gallery of portraits. The greater number of the portraits are
Italian, and they range over all classes of society from the Pope
to the peasant. Even Bishop Blougram has the Italian subtlety, and,
like the Monsignore in <i>Pippa Passes</i>, something of the
politic morality of Machiavelli. But Israel, Greece, France, Spain,
Germany, and the days before the <a name='Page196' id=
"Page196"></a><span class='pagenum'>196</span>world was brought
together, furnish him with men drawn as alive. He has painted their
souls, but others have done this kind of painting as well, if not
so minutely. But no others have painted so livingly the outside of
men&mdash;their features one by one, their carriage, their
gestures, their clothing, their walk, their body. All the colours
of their dress and eyes and lips are given. We see them live and
move and have their being. It is the same with his women, but I
keep these for further treatment.</p>
<p>4. The next thing I have to say about <i>Sordello</i> concerns
what I call its illustrative episodes. Browning, wishing to
illuminate his subject, sometimes darts off from it into an
elaborate simile as Homer does. But in Homer the simile is
carefully set, and explained to be a comparison. It is not mixed up
with the text. It is short, rarely reaching more than ten lines. In
Browning, it is glided into without any preparation, and at first
seems part of the story. Nor are we always given any intimation of
its end. And Browning is led away by his imaginative pleasure in
its invention to work it up with adventitious ornament of colour
and scenery; having, in his excitement of invention, lost all power
of rejecting any additional touch which occurs to him, so that the
illustration, swelling out into a preposterous length, might well
be severed from the book and made into a separate poem. Moreover,
these long illustrations are often but faintly connected with the
subject they are used to illumine; and they delay the movement of
the poem while they confuse the reader. The <a name='Page197' id=
"Page197"></a><span class='pagenum'>197</span>worst of these, worst
as an illustration, but in itself an excellent fragment to isolate
as a picture-poem, is the illustration of the flying slave who
seeks his tribe beyond the Mountains of the Moon. It is only to
throw light on a moment of Salinguerra's discursive thought, and is
far too big for that. It is more like an episode than an
illustration. I quote it not only to show what I mean, but also for
its power. It is in Bk. iv.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"As, shall I say, some Ethiop, past pursuit</p>
<p>Of all enslavers, dips a shackled foot</p>
<p>Burnt to the blood, into the drowsy black</p>
<p>Enormous watercourse which guides him back</p>
<p>To his own tribe again, where he is king;</p>
<p>And laughs because he guesses, numbering</p>
<p>The yellower poison-wattles on the pouch</p>
<p>Of the first lizard wrested from its couch</p>
<p>Under the slime (whose skin, the while, he strips</p>
<p>To cure his nostril with, and festered lips,</p>
<p>And eyeballs bloodshot through the desert-blast)</p>
<p>That he has reached its boundary, at last</p>
<p>May breathe;&mdash;thinks o'er enchantments of the South</p>
<p>Sovereign to plague his enemies, their mouth,</p>
<p>Eyes, nails, and hair; but, these enchantments tried</p>
<p>In fancy, puts them soberly aside</p>
<p>For truth, projects a cool return with friends,</p>
<p>The likelihood of winning mere amends</p>
<p>Ere long; thinks that, takes comfort silently,</p>
<p>Then, from the river's brink, his wrongs and he,</p>
<p>Hugging revenge close to their hearts, are soon</p>
<p>Off-striding for the Mountains of the Moon."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The best of these is where he illustrates the restless desire of
a poet for the renewal of energy, for finding new worlds to sing.
The poet often seems to stop his work, to be satisfied. "Here I
will rest," he says, "and do no more." But he only waits for a
fresh impulse.</p>

made!</p>
<p>The fault of these illustrations is the fault of the whole poem.
<i>Sordello</i> is obscure, Browning's idolaters say, by
concentration of thought. It is rather obscure by want of that wise
rejection of unnecessary thoughts which is the true concentration.
It is obscure by a reckless misuse of the ordinary rules of
language. It is obscure by a host of parentheses introduced to
express thoughts which are only suggested, half-shaped, and which
are frequently interwoven with parentheses introduced <a name=
'Page199' id="Page199"></a><span class='pagenum'>199</span>into the
original parentheses. It is obscure by the worst punctuation I ever
came across, but this was improved in the later editions. It is
obscure by multitudinous fancies put in whether they have to do
with the subject or not, and by multitudinous deviations within
those fancies. It is obscure by Browning's effort to make words
express more than they are capable of expressing.</p>
<p>It is no carping criticism to say this of Browning's work in
<i>Sordello</i>, because it is the very criticism his
after-practice as an artist makes. He gave up these efforts to
force, like Procrustes, language to stretch itself or to cut itself
down into forms it could not naturally take; and there is no more
difficulty in most of his earlier poems than there is in
<i>Paracelsus</i>. Only a little of the Sordellian agonies remains
in them, only that which was natural to Browning's genius. The
interwoven parentheses remain, the rushes of invention into double
and triple illustrations, the multiplication of thought on thought;
but for these we may even be grateful. Opulence and plenitude of
this kind are not common; we are not often granted a man who flings
imaginations, fancies and thoughts from him as thick and bright as
sparks from a grinder's wheel. It is not every poet who is
unwilling to leave off, who finds himself too full to stop. "These
bountiful wits," as Lamb said, "always give full measure, pressed
down, and running over."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3><i>BROWNING AND SORDELLO</i></h3>
<p>There are certain analogies between Browning as a poet and the
Sordello of the poem; between his relation to the world of his time
and that of Sordello to his time; and finally, between Browning's
language in this poem and the change in the Italian language which
he imputes to the work of Sordello. This chapter will discuss these
analogies, and close with an appreciation of Browning's position
between the classic and romantic schools of poetry.</p>
<p>The analogies of which I write may be denied, but I do not think
they can be disproved. Browning is, no doubt, separate from
Sordello in his own mind, but underneath the young poet he is
creating, he is continually asking himself the same question which
Sordello asks&mdash;What shall I do as an artist? To what
conclusion shall I come with regard to my life as a poet? It is no
small proof of this underlying personal element in the first three
books of the poem that at the end of the third book Browning flings
himself suddenly out of the medi&aelig;val world and the men he has
created, and waking into 1835-40 at Venice, asks himself&mdash;What
am I writing, and why? What is my aim <a name='Page201' id=
"Page201"></a><span class='pagenum'>201</span>in being a poet? Is
it worth my while to go on with Sordello's story, and why is it
worth the telling? In fact, he allows us to think that he has been
describing in Sordello's story a transitory phase of his own
career. And then, having done this, he tells how he got out of
confusion into clearer light.</p>
<p>The analogy between Browning's and Sordello's time is not a weak
one. The spirit of the world, between 1830 and 1840 in England,
resembled in many ways the spirit abroad at the beginning of the
thirteenth century. The country had awakened out of a long sleep,
and was extraordinarily curious not only with regard to life and
the best way to live it, but also with regard to government, law,
the condition of the people, the best kind of religion and how best
to live it, the true aims of poetry and how it was to be written,
what subjects it should work on, what was to be the mother-motive
of it, that is, what was the mother-motive of all the arts. And
this curiosity deepened from year to year for fifty years. But even
stronger than the curiosity was the eager individualism of this
time, which extended into every sphere of human thought and action,
and only began about 1866 to be balanced by an equally strong
tendency towards collectivism.</p>
<p>These two elements in the time-spirit did not produce, in a
settled state like England, the outward war and confusion they
produced in the thirteenth century, though they developed after
1840, in '48, into a European storm&mdash;but they did produce a
confused welter of mingled thoughts concerning the sources and ends
of human life, the action it should take, and why it should take
it. The poetry of Arnold and Clough represents with great clearness
<a name='Page202' id="Page202"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>202</span>the further development in the soul of man of
this confusion. I think that Browning has represented in the first
three books of <i>Sordello</i> his passage through this tossing sea
of thought.</p>
<p>He had put into <i>Paracelsus</i> all that he had worked out
with clearness during his youth; his theory of life is stated with
lucidity in that poem. But when it was finished, and he had
entered, like Sordello from Goito into Mantua, into the crowd and
clash of the world; when, having published <i>Pauline</i> and
<i>Paracelsus</i>, he had, like Sordello, met criticism and
misunderstanding, his Paracelsian theory did not seem to explain
humanity as clearly as he imagined. It was only a theory; Would it
stand the test of life among mankind, be a saving and healing
prophecy? Life lay before him, now that the silent philosophising
of poetic youth was over, in all its inexplicable, hurried,
tormented, involved, and multitudinously varied movement. He had
built up a transcendental building<a name='FNanchor_9_9' id=
"FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href='#Footnote_9_9'>[9]</a> in
<i>Paracelsus</i>. Was it all to fall in ruin? No answer came when
he looked forth on humanity over whose landscape the irony of the
gods, a bitter mist, seemed to brood. At what then shall he aim as
a poet? What shall be his subject-matter? How is life to be
lived?</p>
<p>Then he thought that he would, as a poet, describe his own time
and his own soul under the character of Sordello, and place
Sordello in a time more stormy than his own. And he would make
Sordello of an exceptional temper like himself, and <a name=
'Page203' id="Page203"></a><span class='pagenum'>203</span>to clash
with <i>his</i> time as he was then clashing with his own. With
these thoughts he wrote the first books of <i>Sordello</i>, and
Naddo, the critic of Sordello's verses, represents the critics of
Paracelsus and the early poems. I have experienced, he says of
himself in <i>Sordello</i>, something of the spite of fate.</p>
<p>Then, having done this, he leaves Sordello at the end of the
third book, and turns, beset with a thousand questions, to himself
and his art in a personal digression. Reclining on a ruined
palace-step at Venice, he thinks of Eglamor who made a flawless
song, the type of those who reach their own perfection here; and
then of Sordello who made a song which stirred the world far more
than Eglamor's, which yet was not flawless, not perfect; but
because of its imperfection looked forward uncontented to a higher
song. Shall he, Browning the poet, choose Eglamor or Sordello; even
though Sordello perish without any achievement? And he chooses to
sail for ever towards the infinite, chooses the imperfection which
looks forward. A sailor who loves voyaging may say, when
weather-bound, "Here rest, unlade the ship, sleep on this grassy
bank." 'Tis but a moment on his path; let the wind change, and he
is away again, whether triumph or shipwreck await him, for ever</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The tempter of the everlasting steppe.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That much is then settled for life and for poetry. And in that
choice of endless aspiration Browning confirms all that he thought,
with regard to half of his theory of life, in <i>Paracelsus</i>.
This is his first thought for life, and it is embodied in the whole
<a name='Page204' id="Page204"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>204</span>of Sordello's career. Sordello is never content
with earth, either when he is young, or when he passes into the
world, or when he dies not having attained or been already
perfect&mdash;a thought which is as much at the root of romanticism
as of Christianity. Then comes the further question: To whom shall
I dedicate the service of my art? Who shall be my motive, the Queen
whom I shall love and write of; and he thinks of Sordello who asks
that question and who, for the time, answers "Palma," that is, the
passion of love.</p>
<p>"But now, shall I, Browning, take as my Queen"&mdash;and he
symbolises his thought in the girls he sees in the boats from his
palace steps&mdash;"that girl from Bassano, or from Asolo, or her
from Padua; that is, shall I write of youth's love, of its tragic
or its comedy, of its darkness, joy and beauty only? No, he
answers, not of that stuff shall I make my work, but of that sad
dishevelled ghost of a girl, half in rags, with eyes inveterately
full of tears; of wild, worn, care-bitten, ravishing, piteous, and
pitiful Humanity, who begs of me and offers me her faded love in
the street corners. She shall be my Queen, the subject of my song,
the motive of my poetry. She may be guilty, warped awry from her
birth, and now a tired harlotry; but she shall rest on my shoulder
and I shall comfort her. She is false, mistaken, degraded,
ignorant, but she moves blindly from evil to good, and from lies to
truth, and from ignorance to knowledge, and from all to love; and
all her errors prove that she has another world in which, the
errors being worked through, she will develop into perfectness.
Slowly she moves, step by step; but not a millionth part <a name=
'Page205' id="Page205"></a><span class='pagenum'>205</span>is here
done of what she will do at last. That is the matter of my poetry,
which, in its infinite change and hopes, I shall express in my
work. I shall see it, say what I have seen, and it may be</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Impart the gift of seeing to the rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Therefore I have made Sordello, thus far, with all his weakness
and wrong&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>moulded, made anew</p>
<p>A Man, and give him to be turned and tried,</p>
<p>Be angry with or pleased at."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And then Browning severs himself from Sordello. After this
retirement of thought into himself, described as taking place in
Venice during an hour, but I dare say ranging over half a year in
reality, he tells the rest of Sordello's story from the outside, as
a spectator and describer.</p>
<p>Browning has now resolved to dedicate his art, which is his
life, to love of Humanity, of that pale dishevelled girl, unlovely
and lovely, evil and good; and to tell the story of individual men
and women, and of as many as possible; to paint the good which is
always mixed with their evil; to show that their failures and sins
point to a success and goodness beyond, because they emerged from
aspiration and aspiration from the divinity at the root of human
nature. But to do this, a poet must not live like Sordello, in
abstractions, nor shrink from the shock of men and circumstance,
nor refuse to take men and life as they are&mdash;but throw himself
into the vital present, with its difficulties, baffling elements
and limitations; take its failures for his own; go through them
while he looks beyond them, and, because he looks beyond <a name=
'Page206' id="Page206"></a><span class='pagenum'>206</span>them,
never lose hope, or retreat from life, or cease to fight his way
onward. And, to support him in this, there is but one
thing&mdash;infinite love, pity, and sympathy for mankind,
increased, not lessened by knowledge of the sins and weakness, the
failure and despairs of men. This is Browning's second thought for
life. But this is the very thing Sordello, as conceived by
Browning, did not and could not do. He lived in abstractions and in
himself; he tried to discard his human nature, or to make it bear
more than it could bear. He threw overboard the natural physical
life of the body because it limited, he thought, the outgoings of
the imaginative soul, and only found that in weakening the body he
enfeebled the soul. At every point he resented the limits of human
life and fought against them. Neither would he live in the world
allotted to him, nor among the men of his time, nor in its turmoil;
but only in imagination of his own inner world, among men whom he
created for himself, of which world he was to be sole king. He had
no love for men; they wearied, jarred, and disturbed his ideal
world. All he wanted was their applause or their silence, not their
criticism, not their affection. And of course human love and
sympathy for men and insight into them, departed from him, and with
them his art departed. He never became a true poet.</p>
<p>It is this failure, passing through several phases of life in
which action is demanded of Sordello, that Browning desired to
record in the last three books of the poem. And he thinks it worth
doing because it is human, and the record of what is human is
always of worth to man. He paints Sordello's <a name='Page207' id=
"Page207"></a><span class='pagenum'>207</span>passage through phase
after phase of thought and act in the outside world, in all of
which he seems for the moment to succeed or to touch the verge of
success, but in which his neglect of the needs of the body and the
uncontentment of his soul produce failure. At last, at the very
moment of death he knows why he failed, and sees, as through a
glass darkly, the failure making the success of the world to come.
The revelation bursts his heart.</p>
<p>And now what is the end, what is the result for man of this long
striving of Sordello? Nothing! Nothing has been done. Yet no, there
is one result. The imperfect song he made when he was young at
Goito, in the flush of happiness, when he forgot himself in love of
nature and of the young folk who wandered rejoicing through the
loveliness of nature&mdash;that song is still alive, not in the
great world among the noble women and warriors of the time, but on
the lips of the peasant girls of Asolo who sing it on dewy mornings
when they climb the castle hill. This is the outcome of Sordello's
life, and it sounds like irony on Browning's lips. It is not so;
the irony is elsewhere in the poem, and is of another kind. Here,
the conclusion is,&mdash;that the poem, or any work of art, made in
joy, in sympathy with human life, moved by the love of loveliness
in man or in nature, lives and lasts in beauty, heals and makes
happy the world. And it has its divine origin in the artist's loss
of himself in humanity, and his finding of himself, through union
with humanity, in union with God the eternal poet. In this is
hidden the life of an artist's greatness. And here the little song,
which <a name='Page208' id="Page208"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>208</span>gives joy to a child, and fits in with and
enhances its joy, is greater in the eyes of the immortal judges
than all the glory of the world which Sordello sought so long for
himself alone. It is a truth Browning never failed to record, the
greatness and power of the things of love; for, indeed, love being
infinite and omnipotent, gives to its smallest expression the glory
of all its qualities.</p>
<p>The second of these analogies between Browning and Sordello
relates to Browning's treatment of the English language in the poem
of <i>Sordello</i> and what he pictures Sordello as doing for the
Italian language in the poem. The passage to which I refer is about
half-way in the second book. As there is no real ground for
representing Sordello as working any serious change in the Italian
tongue of literature except a slight phrase in a treatise of
Dante's, the representation is manifestly an invention of
Browning's added to the character of Sordello as conceived by
himself. As such it probably comes out of, and belongs to, his own
experience. The Sordello who acts thus with language represents the
action of Browning himself at the time he was writing the poem. If
so, the passage is full of interest.</p>
<p>All we know about Sordello as a poet is that he wrote some
Italian poems. Those by which he was famous were in
Proven&ccedil;al. In Dante's treatise on the use of his native
tongue, he suggests that Sordello was one of the pioneers of
literary Italian. So, at least, Browning seems to infer from the
passage, for he makes it the motive of his little "excursus" on
Sordello's presumed effort to strike out a new form and method in
poetic language. <a name='Page209' id="Page209"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>209</span>Nothing was more needed than such an effort if
any fine literature were to arise in Italy. In this unformed but
slowly forming thirteenth century the language was in as great a
confusion&mdash;and, I may say, as individual (for each poet wrote
in his own dialect) as the life of the century.</p>
<p>What does Browning make Sordello do? He has brought him to
Mantua as the accepted master of song; and Sordello burns to be
fully recognised as the absolute poet. He has felt for some time
that while he cannot act well he can imagine action well. And he
sings his imaginations. But there is at the root of his singing a
love of the applause of the people more than a love of song for
itself. And he fails to please. So Sordello changes his subject and
sings no longer of himself in the action of the heroes he imagines,
but of abstract ideas, philosophic dreams and problems. The very
critics cried that he had left human nature behind him. Vexed at
his failure, and still longing to catch the praise of men, that he
may confirm his belief that he is the loftiest of poets, he makes
another effort to amaze the world. "I'll write no more of imaginary
things," he cries; "I will catch the crowd by reorganising the
language of poetry, by new arrangements of metre and words, by
elaborate phraseology, especially by careful concentration of
thought into the briefest possible frame of words. I will take the
stuff of thought&mdash;that is, the common language&mdash;beat it
on the anvil into new shapes, break down the easy flow of the
popular poetry, and scarcely allow a tithe of the original words I
have written to see the light,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page210' id="Page210"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>210</p>
<p class='i12'>welding words into the crude</p>
<p>Mass from the new speech round him, till a rude</p>
<p>Armour was hammered out, in time to be</p>
<p>Approved beyond the Roman panoply</p>
<p>Melted to make it."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is, he dissolved the Roman dialect to beat out of it an
Italian tongue. And in this new armour of language he clothed his
thoughts. But the language broke away from his thoughts: neither
expressed them nor made them clear. The people failed to understand
his thought, and at the new ways of using language the critics
sneered. "Do get back," they said, "to the simple human heart, and
tell its tales in the simple language of the people."</p>
<p>I do not think that the analogy can be missed. Browning is
really describing&mdash;with, perhaps, a half-scornful reference to
his own desire for public appreciation&mdash;what he tried to do in
<i>Sordello</i> for the language in which his poetry was to be
written. I have said that when he came to write <i>Sordello</i> his
mind had fallen back from the clear theory of life laid down in
<i>Paracelsus</i> into a tumbled sea of troubled thoughts; and
<i>Sordello</i> is a welter of thoughts tossing up and down, now
appearing, then disappearing, and then appearing again in
conjunction with new matter, like objects in a sea above which a
cyclone is blowing. Or we may say that his mind, before and during
the writing of <i>Sordello</i>, was like the thirteenth century,
pressing blindly in vital disturbance towards an unknown goal. That
partly accounts for the confused recklessness of the language of
the poem. But a great many of the tricks Browning now played with
his poetic language <a name='Page211' id="Page211"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>211</span>were deliberately done. He had tried&mdash;like
Sordello at the Court of Love&mdash;a love-poem in <i>Pauline</i>.
It had not succeeded. He had tried in <i>Paracelsus</i> to expose
an abstract theory of life, as Sordello had tried writing on
abstract imaginings. That also had failed. Now he
determined&mdash;as he represents Sordello doing&mdash;to alter his
whole way of writing. "I will concentrate now," he thought, "since
they say I am too loose and too diffuse; cut away nine-tenths of
all I write, and leave out every word I can possibly omit. I will
not express completely what I think; I shall only suggest it by an
illustration. And if anything occur to me likely to illuminate it,
I shall not add it afterwards but insert it in a parenthesis. I
will make a new tongue for my poetry." And the result was the style
and the strange manner in which <i>Sordello</i> was written. This
partly excuses its obscurity, if deliberation can be an excuse for
a bad manner in literature. Malice prepense does not excuse a
murder, though it makes it more interesting. Finally, the manner in
which <i>Sordello</i> was written did not please him. He left it
behind him, and <i>Pippa Passes</i>, which followed
<i>Sordello</i>, is as clear and simple as its predecessor is
obscure in style.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the language of <i>Sordello</i>, and, in a lesser
degree, that of all Browning's poetry, proves&mdash;if his whole
way of thought and passion did not also prove it&mdash;that
Browning was not a classic, that he deliberately put aside the
classic traditions in poetry. In this he presents a strong contrast
to Tennyson. Tennyson was possessed by those traditions. His
masters were Homer, Vergil, Milton and the rest of those who wrote
with <a name='Page212' id="Page212"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>212</span>measure, purity, and temperance; and from whose
poetry proceeded a spirit of order, of tranquillity, of clearness,
of simplicity; who were reticent in ornament, in illustration, and
stern in rejection of unnecessary material. None of these classic
excellences belong to Browning, nor did he ever try to gain them,
and that was, perhaps, a pity. But, after all, it would have been
of no use had he tried for them. We cannot impose from without on
ourselves that which we have not within; and Browning was, in
spirit, a pure romantic, not a classic. Tennyson never allowed what
romanticism he possessed to have its full swing. It always wore the
classic dress, submitted itself to the classic traditions, used the
classic forms. In the <i>Idylls of the King</i> he took a romantic
story; but nothing could be more unromantic than many of the
inventions and the characters; than the temper, the morality, and
the conduct of the poem. The Arthurian poets, Malory himself, would
have jumped out their skin with amazement, even with indignation,
had they read it. And a great deal of this oddity, this unfitness
of the matter to the manner, arose from the romantic story being
expressed in poetry written in accordance with classic traditions.
Of course, there were other sources for these inharmonies in the
poem, but that was one, and not the least of them.</p>
<p>Browning had none of these classic traditions. He had his own
matter, quite new stuff it was; and he made his own manner. He did
not go back to the old stories, but, being filled with the romantic
spirit, embodied it in new forms, and drenched with it his
subjects, whether he took <a name='Page213' id=
"Page213"></a><span class='pagenum'>213</span>them from ancient,
medi&aelig;val, Renaissance, or modern life. He felt, and truly,
that it is of the essence of romanticism to be always arising into
new shapes, assimilating itself, century by century, to the needs,
the thought and the passions of growing mankind; progressive, a
lover of change; in steady opposition to that dull conservatism the
tendency to which besets the classic literature.</p>
<p>Browning had the natural faults of the romantic poet; and these
are most remarkable when such a poet is young. The faults are the
opposites of the classic poet's excellences: want of measure, want
of proportion, want of clearness and simplicity, want of
temperance, want of that selective power which knows what to leave
out or when to stop. And these frequently become positive and end
in actual disorder of composition, huddling of the matters treated
of into ill-digested masses, violence in effects and phrase,
bewildering obscurity, sought-out even desperate strangeness of
subject and expression, uncompromising individuality, crude
ornament, and fierce colour. Many examples of these faults are to
be found in <i>Sordello</i> and throughout the work of Browning.
They are the extremes into which the Romantic is frequently
hurried.</p>
<p>But, then, Browning has the natural gifts and excellences of the
romantic poet, and these elements make him dearer than the mere
Classic to a multitude of imaginative persons. One of them is
endless and impassioned curiosity, for ever unsatisfied, always
finding new worlds of thought and feeling into which to make
dangerous and thrilling voyages of discovery&mdash;voyages that are
filled from end to end with incessantly changing adventure, or
<a name='Page214' id="Page214"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>214</span>delight in that adventure. This enchants the
world. And it is not only in his subjects that the romantic poet
shows his curiosity. He is just as curious of new methods of
tragedy, of lyric work, of every mode of poetry; of new ways of
expressing old thoughts; new ways of treating old metres; of the
invention of new metres and new ways of phrasing; of strange and
startling word-combinations, to clothe fittingly the strange and
startling things discovered in human nature, in one's own soul, or
in the souls of others. In ancient days such a temper produced the
many tales of invention which filled the romantic cycles.</p>
<p>Again and again, from century to century, this romantic spirit
has done its re-creating work in the development of poetry in
France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and England. And in 1840, and for
many years afterwards, it produced in Browning, and for our
pleasure, his dramatic lyrics as he called them; his psychological
studies, which I may well call excursions, adventures, battles,
pursuits, retreats, discoveries of the soul; for in the soul of man
lay, for Browning, the forest of Broceliande, the wild country of
Morgan le Fay, the cliffs and moors of Lyonnesse. It was there,
over that unfooted country, that Childe Roland rode to the Dark
Tower. Nor can anything be more in the temper of old spiritual
romance&mdash;though with a strangely modern
<i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i>&mdash;than the great adventure on the
dark common with Christ in <i>Christmas-Eve and Easter-Day</i>.</p>
<p>Another root of the romantic spirit was the sense of, and
naturally the belief in, a world not to be felt of the senses or
analysed by the under<a name='Page215' id=
"Page215"></a><span class='pagenum'>215</span>standing; which was
within the apparent world as its substance or soul, or beyond it as
the power by which it existed; and this mystic belief took, among
poets, philosophers, theologians, warriors and the common people, a
thousand forms, ranging from full-schemed philosophies to the
wildest superstitions. It tended, in its extremes, to make this
world a shadow, a dream; and our life only a real life when it
habitually dwelt in the mystic region mortal eye could not see,
whose voices mortal ear could not receive. Out of this root, which
shot its first fibres into the soul of humanity in the days of the
earliest savage and separated him by an unfathomable gulf from the
brute, arose all the myths and legends and mystic stories which
fill romance. Out of it developed the unquenchable thirst of those
of the romantic temper for communion with the spiritual beings of
this mystic world; a thirst which, however repressed for a time,
always arises again; and is even now arising among the poets of
to-day.</p>
<p>In Browning's view of the natural world some traces of this
element of the romantic spirit may be distinguished, but in his
poetry of Man it scarcely appears. Nor, indeed, is he ever the true
mystic. He had too much of the sense which handles daily life; he
saw the facts of life too clearly, to fall into the vaguer regions
of mysticism. But one part of its region, and of the romantic
spirit, so incessantly recurs in Browning that it may be said to
underlie the whole of his work. It is that into which the thoughts
and passions of the romantic poets in all ages ran up, as into a
goal&mdash;the conception of a perfect world, beyond this
visible, in which the <a name='Page216' id=
"Page216"></a><span class='pagenum'>216</span>noble hopes, loves
and work of humanity&mdash;baffled, limited, and ruined
here&mdash;should be fulfilled and satisfied. The Greeks did not
frame this conception as a people, though Plato outreached towards
it; the Romans had it not, though Vergil seems to have touched it
in hours of inspiration. The Teutonic folk did not possess it till
Christianity invaded them. Of course, it was alive like a beating
heart in Christianity, that most romantic of all religions. But the
Celtic peoples did conceive it before Christianity and with a
surprising fulness, and wherever they went through Europe they
pushed it into the thought, passions and action of human life. And
out of this conception, which among the Irish took form as the Land
of Eternal Youth, love and joy, where human trouble ceased, grew
that element in romance which is perhaps the strongest in
it&mdash;the hunger for eternity, for infinite perfection of being,
and, naturally, for unremitting pursuit of it; and among Christian
folk for a life here which should fit them for perfect life to
come. Christian romance threw itself with fervour into that ideal,
and the pursuit, for example, of the Holy Grail is only one of the
forms of this hunger for eternity and perfection.</p>
<p>Browning possessed this element of romance with remarkable
fulness, and expressed it with undiminished ardour for sixty years
of poetic work. From <i>Pauline</i> to <i>Asolando</i> it reigns
supreme. It is the fountain-source of <i>Sordello</i>&mdash;by the
pervasiveness of which the poem consists. Immortal life in God's
perfection! Into that cry the Romantic's hunger for eternity had
developed in the soul of Browning. His heroes, in drama and lyric,
in <a name='Page217' id="Page217"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>217</span><i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Sordello</i>, pass
into the infinite, there to be completed.</p>
<p>And if I may here introduce a kind of note, it is at this moment
that we ought to take up the <i>Purgatorio</i>, and see Sordello as
Dante saw him in that flowery valley of the Ante-Purgatory when he
talked with Dante and Vergil. He is there a very different person
from the wavering creature Browning drew. He is on the way to that
perfect fulfilment in God which Browning desired for him and all
mankind.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in order to complete this statement, Browning, in
his full idea of life, was not altogether a romantic. He saw there
was a great danger that the romantic mysticism might lead its
pursuers to neglect the duties of life, or lessen their interest in
the drama of mankind. Therefore he added to his cry for eternity
and perfection, his other cry: "Recognise your limitations, and
work within them, while you must never be content with them. Give
yourself in love and patience to the present labour of mankind; but
never imagine for a moment that it ends on earth." He thus combined
with the thirst of the romantic for eternity the full ethical
theory of life, as well as the classic poet's determination to
represent the complete aspect of human life on earth. At this
point, but with many fantastic deviations due to his prevailing
romanticism, he was partly of the classic temper. The poem of
<i>Sordello</i> is not without an image of this temper, set
vigorously in contrast with Sordello himself. This is Salinguerra,
who takes the world as it is, and is only anxious to do what lies
before him day by day. His long soliloquy, in which for the moment
he indulges in dreams, ends in the <a name='Page218' id=
"Page218"></a><span class='pagenum'>218</span>simple resolution to
fight on, hour by hour, as circumstances call on him.</p>
<p>Browning's position, then, is a combination of the romantic and
classical, of the Christian and ethical, of the imaginative and
scientific views of human life; of the temper which says, "Here
only is our life, here only our concern," and that which says, "Not
here, but hereafter is our life." "Here, and hereafter," answered
Browning. "Live within earth's limits with all your force; never
give in, fight on; but always transcend your fullest action in
aspiration, faith and love."</p>
<p>It amuses me sometimes the way he is taken by his readers. The
romantic and the Christian folk often claim him as the despiser of
this world, as one who bids us live wholly for the future, or in
the mystic ranges of thought and passion. The scientific,
humanitarian, and ethical folk accept that side of him which agrees
with their views of human life&mdash;views which exclude God,
immortality, and a world beyond&mdash;that is, they take as the
whole of Browning the lesser part of his theory of life. This is
not creditable to their understanding, though it is natural enough.
We may accept it as an innocent example of the power of a strong
bias in human nature. But it is well to remember that the romantic,
Christian, mystic elements of human life are more important in
Browning's eyes than the ethical or scientific; that the latter are
nothing to him without the former; that the best efforts of the
latter for humanity are in his belief not only hopeless, but the
stuff that dreams are made of, without the former. In the
combination of both is Browning's message to mankind.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3><i>THE DRAMAS</i></h3>
<p>Of the great poets who, not being born dramatists, have
attempted to write dramas in poetry, Browning was the most
persevering. I suppose that, being conscious of his remarkable
power in the representation of momentary action and of states of
the soul, he thought that he could harmonise into a whole the
continuous action of a number of persons, and of their passions in
sword-play with one another; and then conduct to a catastrophe
their interaction. But a man may be capable of writing dramatic
lyrics and dramatic romances without being capable of writing a
drama. Indeed, so different are the two capabilities that I think
the true dramatist could not write such a lyric or romance as
Browning calls dramatic; his genius would carry one or the other
beyond the just limits of this kind of poetry into his own kind.
And the writer of excellent lyrics and romances of this kind will
be almost sure to fail in real drama. I wish, in order to avoid
confusion of thought, that the term "dramatic" were only used of
poetry which belongs to drama itself. I have heard Chaucer called
dramatic. It is a complete misnomer. His genius would have for ever
been unable to produce <a name='Page220' id=
"Page220"></a><span class='pagenum'>220</span>a good drama. Had he
lived in Elizabeth's time, he would, no doubt, have tried to write
one, but he must have failed. The genius for story-telling is just
the genius which is incapable of being a fine dramatist. And the
opposite is also true. Shakespeare, great as his genius was, would
not have been able to write a single one of the Canterbury Tales.
He would have been driven into dramatising them.</p>
<p>Neither Tennyson nor Browning had dramatic genius&mdash;that is,
the power to conceive, build, co-ordinate and finish a drama. But
they thought they had, and we may pardon them for trying their
hand. I can understand the hunger and thirst which beset great
poets, who had, like these two men, succeeded in so many different
kinds of poetry, to succeed also in the serious drama, written in
poetry. It is a legitimate ambition; but poets should be acquainted
with their limitations, and not waste their energies or our
patience on work which they cannot do well. That men like Tennyson
and Browning, who were profoundly capable of understanding what a
great drama means, and is; who had read what the master-tragedians
of Greece have done; who knew their Shakespeare, to say nothing of
the other Elizabethan dramatists; who had seen Moli&egrave;re on
the stage; who must have felt how the thing ought to be done,
composed, and versed; that they, having written a play like
<i>Harold</i> or <i>Strafford</i>, should really wish to stage it,
or having heard and seen it on the stage should go on writing more
dramas, would seem incomprehensible, were it not that power to do
one thing very well is so curiously liable to self-deceit.</p>
<p><a name='Page221' id="Page221"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>221</span>The writing of the first drama is not to be
blamed. It would be unnatural not to try one's hand. It is the
writing of the others which is amazing in men like Tennyson and
Browning. They ought to have felt, being wiser than other men in
poetry, that they had no true dramatic capacity. Other poets who
also tried the drama did know themselves better. Byron wrote
several dramas, but he made little effort to have them represented
on the stage. He felt they were not fit for that; and, moreover,
such scenic poems as <i>Manfred</i> and <i>Cain</i> were not
intended for the stage, and do not claim to be dramas in that
sense. To write things of this kind, making no claim to public
representation, with the purpose of painting a situation of the
soul, is a legitimate part of a poet's work, and among them, in
Browning's work, might be classed <i>In a Balcony</i>, which I
suppose his most devoted worshipper would scarcely call a
drama.</p>
<p>Walter Scott, than whom none could conduct a conversation better
in a novel, or make more living the clash of various minds in a
critical event, whether in a cottage or a palace; whom one would
select as most likely to write a drama well&mdash;had
self-knowledge enough to understand, after his early attempts, that
true dramatic work was beyond his power. Wordsworth also made one
effort, and then said good-bye to drama. Coleridge tried, and
staged <i>Remorse</i>. It failed and deserved to fail. To read it
is to know that the writer had no sense of an audience in his mind
as he wrote it&mdash;a fatal want in a dramatist. Even its purple
patches of fine poetry and its noble melody of verse did not redeem
it. Shelley did better than these brethren <a name='Page222' id=
"Page222"></a><span class='pagenum'>222</span>of his, and that is
curious. One would say, after reading his previous poems, that he
was the least likely of men to write a true drama. Yet the
<i>Cenci</i> approaches that goal, and the fragment of <i>Charles
the First</i> makes so great a grip on the noble passions and on
the intellectual eye, and its few scenes are so well woven, that it
is one of the unfulfilled longings of literature that it should
have been finished. Yet Shelley himself gave it up. He knew, like
the others, that the drama was beyond his power.</p>
<p>Tennyson and Browning did not so easily recognise their limits.
They went on writing dramas, not for the study, which would have
been natural and legitimate, but for the stage. This is a curious
psychological problem, and there is only one man who could have
given us, if he had chosen, a poetic study of it, and that is
Browning himself. I wish, having in his mature age read
<i>Strafford</i> over, and then read his other dramas&mdash;all of
them full of the same dramatic weaknesses as
<i>Strafford</i>&mdash;he had analysed himself as "the poet who
would be a dramatist and could not." Indeed, it is a pity he did
not do this. He was capable of smiling benignly at himself, and
sketching himself as if he were another man; a thing of which
Tennyson, who took himself with awful seriousness, and walked with
himself as a Druid might have walked in the sacred grove of Mona,
was quite incapable.</p>
<p>However, the three important dramas of Tennyson are better, as
dramas, than Browning's. That is natural enough. For Browning's
dramas were written when he was young, when his knowledge of the
dramatic art was small, and when his <a name='Page223' id=
"Page223"></a><span class='pagenum'>223</span>intellectual powers
were not fully developed. Tennyson wrote his when his knowledge of
the Drama was great, and when his intellect had undergone years of
careful training. He studied the composition and architecture of
the best plays; he worked at the stage situations; he created a
blank verse for his plays quite different from that he used in his
poems, and a disagreeable thing it is; he introduced songs, like
Shakespeare, at happy moments; he imitated the old work, and at the
same time strove hard to make his own original. He laboured at the
history, and <i>Becket</i> and <i>Harold</i> are painfully
historical. History should not master a play, but the play the
history. The poet who is betrayed into historical accuracy so as to
injure the development of his conception in accordance with
imaginative truth, is lost; and <i>Harold</i> and <i>Becket</i>
both suffer from Tennyson falling into the hands of those critical
historians whom Tennyson consulted.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, by dint of laborious intellectual work, but not by
the imagination, not by dramatic genius, Tennyson arrived at a
relative success. He did better in these long dramas than
Coleridge, Wordsworth, Scott or Byron. <i>Queen Mary, Harold</i>,
and <i>Becket</i> get along in one's mind with some swiftness when
one reads them in an armchair by the fire. Some of the characters
are interesting and wrought with painful skill. We cannot forget
the pathetic image of Queen Mary, which dwells in the mind when the
play has disappeared; nor the stately representation in
<i>Becket</i> of the mighty and overshadowing power of Rome,
claiming as its own possession the soul of the world. But the minor
characters; the action; the play of the <a name='Page224' id=
"Page224"></a><span class='pagenum'>224</span>characters, great and
small, and of the action and circumstance together towards the
catastrophe&mdash;these things were out of Tennyson's reach, and
still more out of Browning's. They could both build up characters,
and Browning better than Tennyson; they could both set two people
to talk together, and by their talk to reveal their character to
us; but to paint action, and the action of many men and women
moving to a plotted end; to paint human life within the limits of a
chosen subject, changing and tossing and unconscious of its fate,
in a town, on a battlefield, in the forum, in a wild wood, in the
king's palace or a shepherd farm; and to image this upon the stage,
so that nothing done or said should be unmotived, unrelated to the
end, or unnatural; of that they were quite incapable, and Browning
more incapable than Tennyson.</p>
<p>There is another thing to say. The three long dramas of Tennyson
are better as dramas than the long ones of Browning. But the
smaller dramatic pieces of Browning are much better than the
smaller ones of Tennyson. <i>The Promise of May</i> is bad in
dialogue, bad in composition, bad in delineation of character,
worst of all in its subject, in its plot, and in its motives.
<i>The Cup</i>, and <i>The Falcon</i>, a beautiful story
beautifully written by Boccaccio, is strangely dulled, even
vulgarised, by Tennyson. The <i>Robin Hood</i> play has gracious
things in it, but as a drama it is worthless, and it is impossible
to forgive Tennyson for his fairies. All these small plays are
dreadful examples of what a great poet may do when he works in a
vehicle&mdash;if I may borrow a term from painting&mdash;for which
he has no natural capacity, but for which he thinks <a name=
'Page225' id="Page225"></a><span class='pagenum'>225</span>he has.
He is then like those sailors, and meets justly the same fate, who
think that because they can steer a boat admirably, they can also
drive a coach and four. The love scene in <i>Becket</i> between
Rosamund and Henry illustrates my meaning. It was a subject in
itself that Tennyson ought to have done well, and would probably
have done well in another form of poetry; but, done in a form for
which he had no genius, he did it badly. It is the worst thing in
the play. Once, however, he did a short drama fairly well. <i>The
Cup</i> has some dramatic movement, its construction is clear, its
verse imaginative, its scenery well conceived; and its motives are
simple and easily understood. But then, as in <i>Becket</i>, Irving
stood at his right hand, and advised him concerning dramatic
changes and situations. Its passion is, however, cold; it leaves us
unimpressed.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Browning's smaller dramatic pieces&mdash;I
cannot call them dramas&mdash;are much better than those of
Tennyson. <i>Pippa Passes, A Soul's Tragedy, In a Balcony</i>,
stand on a much higher level, aim higher, and reach their aim more
fully than Tennyson's shorter efforts. They have not the qualities
which fit them for representation, but they have those which fit
them for thoughtful and quiet reading. No one thinks much of the
separate personalities; our chief interest is in following
Browning's imagination as it invents new phases of his subject, and
plays like a sword in sunlight, in and out of these phases. As
poems of the soul in severe straits, made under a quasi-dramatic
form, they reach a high excellence, but all that we like best in
them, when we follow them as <a name='Page226' id=
"Page226"></a><span class='pagenum'>226</span>situations of the
soul, we should most dislike when represented on the stage.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p><i>Strafford</i> is, naturally, the most immature of the dramas,
written while he was still writing <i>Paracelsus</i>, and when he
was very young. It is strange to compare the greater part of its
prosaic verse with the rich poetic verse of <i>Paracelsus</i>; and
this further illustrates how much a poet suffers when he writes in
a form which is not in his genius. There are only a very few
passages in <i>Strafford</i> which resemble poetry until we come to
the fifth Act, where Browning passes from the jerky, allusive but
rhythmical prose of the previous acts into that talk between
Strafford and his children which has poetic charm, clearness and
grace. The change does not last long, and when Hollis, Charles and
Lady Carlisle, followed by Pym, come in, the whole Act is in
confusion. Nothing is clear, except absence of the clearness
required for a drama. But the previous Acts are even more obscure;
not indeed for their readers, but for hearers in a theatre
who&mdash;since they are hurried on at once to new matter&mdash;are
forced to take in on the instant what the dramatist means. It would
be impossible to tell at first hearing what the chopped-up
sentences, the interrupted phrases, the interjected "nots" and
"buts" and "yets" are intended to convey. The conversation is
mangled. This vice does not prevail in the other dramas to the same
extent as in <i>Strafford</i>. Browning had learnt his lesson, I
suppose, when he saw <i>Strafford</i> represented. But it sorely
prevails in <i>Colombe's Birthday</i>.</p>
<p><a name='Page227' id="Page227"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>227</span>Strafford is brought before us as a politician,
as the leader of the king's side in an austere crisis of England's
history. The first scene puts the great quarrel forward as the
ground on which the drama is to be wrought. An attempt is made to
represent the various elements of the popular storm in the
characters of Pym, Hampden, the younger Vane and others, and
especially in the relations between Pym and Strafford, who are set
over, one against the other, with some literary power. But the
lines on which the action is wrought are not simple. No audience
could follow the elaborate network of intrigue which, in Browning's
effort to represent too much of the history, he has made so
confused. Strong characterisation perishes in this effort to write
a history rather than a drama. What we chiefly see of the crisis is
a series of political intrigues at the Court carried out by base
persons, of whom the queen is the basest, to ruin Strafford; the
futility of Strafford's sentimental love of the king, whom he
despises while he loves him; Strafford's blustering weakness and
blindness when he forces his way into the Parliament House, and the
contemptible meanness of Charles. The low intrigues of the Court
leave the strongest impression on the mind, not the mighty
struggle, not the fate of the Monarchy and its dark supporter.</p>
<p>Browning tries&mdash;as if he had forgotten that which should
have been first in his mind&mdash;to lift the main struggle into
importance in the last Act, but he fails. That which ought to be
tragic is merely sentimental. Indeed, sentimentality is the curse
of the play. Strafford's love of the king is almost maudlin. The
scenes between Strafford and <a name='Page228' id=
"Page228"></a><span class='pagenum'>228</span>Pym in which their
ancient friendship is introduced are over-sentimentalised, not only
for their characters, but for the great destinies at stake. Even at
the last, when Pym and Strafford forgive each other and speak of
meeting hereafter, good sense is violated, and the natural dignity
of the scene, and the characters of the men. Strafford is weaker
here, if that were possible, than he is in the rest of the drama.
Nothing can be more unlike the man.</p>
<p>Pym is intended to be especially strong. He is made a blusterer.
He was a gentleman, but in this last scene he is hateful. As to
Charles, he was always a selfish liar, but he was not a coward, and
a coward he becomes in this play. He, too, is sentimentalised by
his uxoriousness. Lady Carlisle is invented. I wish she had not
been. Stratford's misfortunes were deep enough without having her
in love with him. I do not believe, moreover, that any woman in the
whole world from the very beginning was ever so obscure in her
speech to the man she loves as Lady Carlisle was to Strafford. And
the motive of her obscurity&mdash;that if she discloses the King's
perfidy she robs Strafford of that which is dearest to
him&mdash;his belief in the King's affection for him&mdash;is no
doubt very fine, but the woman was either not in love who argued in
that way, or a fool; for Strafford knew, and lets her understand
that he knew, the treachery of the King. But Browning meant her to
be in love, and to be clever.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The next play Browning wrote, undeterred by the fate of
<i>Strafford</i>, was <i>King Victor and King Charles</i>. The
subject is historical, but it is modified <a name='Page229' id=
"Page229"></a><span class='pagenum'>229</span>by Browning, quite
legitimately, to suit his own purposes. In itself the plot is
uninteresting. King Victor, having brought the kingdom to the verge
of ruin, abdicates and hands the crown to his son, believing him to
be a weak-minded person whose mistakes will bring
him&mdash;Victor&mdash;back to the throne, when he can throw upon
the young king the responsibility of the mess he has himself made
of the kingdom. Charles turns out to be a strong character, sets
right the foreign affairs of the kingdom, and repairs his father's
misgovernment. Then Victor, envious and longing for power,
conspires to resume the throne, and taken prisoner, begs back the
crown. Charles, touched as a son, and against his better judgment,
restores his father, who immediately and conveniently dies. It is a
play of court intrigue and of politics, and these are not made
interesting by any action, such as we call dramatic, in the play.
From end to end there is no inter-movement of public passion. There
are only four characters. D'Ormea, the minister, is a mere stick in
a prime-minister's robes and serves Victor and Charles with equal
ease, in order to keep his place. He is not even subtle in his
<i>r&ocirc;le</i>. When we think what Browning would have made of
him in a single poem, and contrast it with what he has made of him
here, we are again impressed with Browning's strange loss of power
when he is writing drama. Victor and Charles are better drawn than
any characters in <i>Strafford</i>; and Polyxena is a great advance
on Lady Carlisle. But this piece is not a drama; it is a study of
soul-situations, and none of them are of any vital importance.
There is far too great an improbability <a name='Page230' id=
"Page230"></a><span class='pagenum'>230</span>in the conception of
Charles. A weak man in private becomes a strong man in public life.
To represent him, having known and felt his strength, as relapsing
into his previous weakness when it endangers all his work, is quite
too foolish. He did not do it in history. Browning, with
astonishing want of insight, makes him do it here, and adds to it a
foolish anger with his wife because she advises him against it. And
the reason he does it and is angry with his wife, is a merely
sentimental one&mdash;a private, unreasoning, childish love of his
father, such a love as Strafford is supposed to have for Charles
I.&mdash;the kind of love which intruded into public affairs ruins
them, and which, being feeble and for an unworthy object, injures
him who gives it and him who receives it. Even as a study of
characters, much more as a drama, this piece is a failure, and the
absence of poetry in it is amazing.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The Return of the Druses approaches more nearly to a true drama
than its predecessors; it is far better written; it has several
fine motives which are intelligently, but not dramatically, worked
out; and it is with great joy that one emerges at last into a
little poetry. Browning, having more or less invented his subject,
is not seduced, by the desire to be historical, to follow apparent
instead of imaginative truth; nor are we wearied by his unhappy
efforts to analyse, in disconnected conversations, political
intrigue. Things are in this play as the logic of imaginative
passion wills, as Browning's conception drove him. But,
unfortunately for its success as a true drama, Browning <a name=
'Page231' id="Page231"></a><span class='pagenum'>231</span>doubles
and redoubles the motives which impel his characters. Djabal,
Anael, Loys, have all of them, two different and sometimes opposite
aims working in them. They are driven now by one, now by the other,
and the changes of speech and action made by the different motives
surging up, alternately or together, within their will, are so
swift and baffling that an audience would be utterly bewildered. It
is amusing to follow the prestidigitation of Browning's intellect
creating this confused battle in souls as long as one reads the
play at home, though even then we wonder why he cannot, at least in
a drama, make a simple situation. If he loved difficult work, this
would be much more difficult to do well than the confused situation
he has not done well. Moreover, the simplified situation would be
effective on the stage; and it would give a great opportunity for
fine poetry. As it is, imaginative work is replaced by intellectual
exercises, poetry is lost in his analysis of complex states of
feeling. However, this involved in-and-out of thought is
entertaining to follow in one's study if not on the stage. It is
done with a loose power no one else in England possessed, and our
only regret is that he did not bridle and master his power.
Finally, with regard to this play, I should like to isolate from it
certain imaginative representations of characters which embody
types of the men of the time, such as the Prefect and the Nuncio.
The last interview between Loys and the Prefect, taken out of the
drama, would be a little masterpiece of characterisation.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p><i>The Blot in the Scutcheon</i> is the finest of all these
<a name='Page232' id="Page232"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>232</span>dramas. It might well be represented on the
stage as a literary drama before those who had already read it, and
who would listen to it for its passion and poetry; but its
ill-construction and the unnaturalness of its situations will
always prevent, and justly, its public success as a drama. It is
full of pathetic and noble poetry; its main characters are clearly
outlined and of a refreshing simplicity. It has few obtrusive
metaphysical or intellectual subtleties&mdash;things which Browning
could not keep out of his dramas, but which only a genius like
Shakespeare can handle on the stage. It has real intensity of
feeling, and the various passions interlock and clash together with
some true dramatic interaction. Their presentation awakens our
pity, and wonder for the blind fates of men. The close leaves us in
sorrow, yet in love with human nature. The pathos of the
catastrophe is the most pathetic thing in Browning. I do not even
except the lovely record of Pompilia. The torture of the human
heart, different but equal, of Tresham and Mildred in the last
scene, is exceedingly bitter in its cry&mdash;too cruel almost to
hear and know, were it not relieved by the beauty of their
tenderness and forgiveness in the hour of death. They die of their
pain, but die loving, and are glad to die. They have all of
them&mdash;Mildred, Tresham, and Mertoun&mdash;sinned as it were by
error. Death unites them in righteousness, loveliness and love. A
fierce, swift storm sweeps out of a clear heaven upon them,
destroys them, and saves them. It is all over in three days. They
are fortunate; their love deserved that the ruin should be brief,
and the reparation be transferred, in a moment, to the grave
justice of eternity.</p>
<p><a name='Page233' id="Page233"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>233</span>The first two acts bear no comparison with the
third. The first scene, with all the servants, only shows how
Browning failed in bringing a number of characters together, and in
making them talk with ease and connectedly. Then, in two acts, the
plot unfolds itself. It is a marvel of bad construction, grossly
improbable, and offends that popular common sense of what is justly
due to the characters concerned and to human nature itself, to
which a dramatist is bound to appeal.</p>
<p>Mildred and Mertoun have loved and sinned. Mertoun visits her
every night. Gerard, an old gamekeeper, has watched him climbing to
her window, and he resolves to tell this fatal tale to Tresham,
Mildred's brother, whose strongest feeling is pride in the
unblemished honour of his house. Meantime Mertoun has asked Tresham
for Mildred's hand in marriage, and these lovers, receiving his
consent, hope that their sin will be purged. Then Gerard tells his
story. Tresham summons Mildred. She confesses the lover, and
Tresham demands his name. To reveal the name would have saved the
situation, as we guess from Tresham's character. His love would
have had time to conquer his pride. But Mildred will not tell the
name, and when Tresham says: "Then what am I to say to Mertoun?"
she answers, "I will marry him." This, and no wonder, seems the
last and crowning dishonour to Tresham, and he curses, as if she
were a harlot, the sister whom he passionately loves.</p>
<p>This is a horrible situation which Browning had no right to
make. The natural thing would be for Mildred to disclose that her
lover and Lord Mertoun, whom she was to marry, were one and the
same. <a name='Page234' id="Page234"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>234</span>There is no adequate reason, considering the
desperate gravity of the situation, for her silence; it ought to be
accounted for and it is not, nor could it be. Her refusal to tell
her lover's name, her confession of her dishonour and at the same
time her acceptance of Mertoun as a husband at her brother's hands,
are circumstances which shock probability and common human
nature.</p>
<p>Then it is not only this which irritates a reader; it is also
the stupidity of Tresham. That also is most unnatural. He believes
that the girl whom he has loved and honoured all his life, whose
purity was as a star to him, will accept Mertoun while she was
sinning with another! He should have felt that this was incredible,
and immediately understood, as Guendolen does, that her lover and
Mertoun were the same. Dulness and blindness so improbable are
unfitting in a drama, nor does the passion of his overwhelming
pride excuse him. The central situation is a protracted irritation.
Browning was never a good hand at construction, even in his poems.
His construction is at its very worst in this drama.</p>
<p>But now, when we have, with wrath, accepted this revolting
situation&mdash;which, of course, Browning made in order to have
his tragic close, but which a good dramatist would have arranged so
differently&mdash;we pass into the third act, the tragic close; and
that is simple enough in its lines, quite naturally wrought out,
beautifully felt, and of exquisite tenderness. Rashness of wrath
and pride begin it; Mertoun is slain by Tresham as he climbs to
Mildred's window, though why he should risk her honour any more
when she is <a name='Page235' id="Page235"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>235</span>affianced to him is another of Browning's
maddening improbabilities. And then wrath and pride pass away, and
sorrow and love and the joy of death are woven together in beauty.
If we must go through the previous acts to get to this, we forgive,
for its sake, their wrongness. It has turns of love made
exquisitely fair by inevitable death, unfathomable depths of
feeling. We touch in these last scenes the sacred love beyond the
world in which forgiveness is forgotten.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p><i>Colombe's Birthday</i> is of all these plays the nearest to a
true drama. It has been represented in America as well as in
England, and its skilful characterisation of Valence, Colombe, and
Berthold has won deserved praise; but it could not hold the stage.
The subject is too thin. Colombe finds out on her birthday that she
is not the rightful heir to the Duchy; but as there is some doubt,
she resolves to fight the question. In her perplexities she is
helped and supported by Valence, an advocate from one of the cities
of the Duchy, who loves her, but whom she believes to serve her
from loyalty alone. Berthold, the true heir, to avoid a quarrel,
offers to marry Colombe, not because he loves her, but as a good
piece of policy. She then finds out that she loves Valence, and
refusing the splendid alliance, leaves the court a private person,
with love and her lover. This slight thing is spun out into five
acts by Browning's metaphysics of love and friendship. There is but
little action, or pressure of the characters into one another. The
intriguing courtiers are dull, and their talk is not knit together.
The only thing alive in them is their <a name='Page236' id=
"Page236"></a><span class='pagenum'>236</span>universal meanness.
That meanness, it is true, enhances the magnanimity of Valence and
Berthold, but its dead level in so many commonplace persons lowers
the dramatic interest of the piece. The play is rather an
interesting conversational poem about the up-growing of love
between two persons of different but equally noble character; who
think love is of more worth than power or wealth, and who are
finally brought together by a bold, rough warrior who despises love
in comparison with policy. Its real action takes place in the
hearts of Valence and Colombe, not in the world of human life; and
what takes place in their hearts is at times so quaintly
metaphysical, so curiously apart from the simplicities of human
love, so complicated, even beyond the complexity of the
situation&mdash;for Browning loved to pile complexity on
complexity&mdash;that it makes the play unfit for public
representation but all the more interesting for private reading.
But, even in the quiet of our room, we ask why Browning put his
subject into a form which did not fit it; why he overloaded the
story of two souls with a host of characters who have no vital
relation to it, and, having none, are extremely wearisome? It might
have been far more successfully done in the form of <i>In a
Balcony</i>, which Browning himself does not class as a drama.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p><i>Luria</i>, the last of the dramas in date of composition, may
be said to have no outward action, except in one scene where
Tiburzio breaks in suddenly to defend Luria, who, like a wounded
stag, stands at bay among the dogs and hunters who suspect his
fidelity to Florence. It is a drama of inward action, <a name=
'Page237' id="Page237"></a><span class='pagenum'>237</span>of
changes in the souls of men. The full purification of Luria is its
one aim, and the motive of Luria himself is a single motive. The
play occupies one day only, and passes in one place.</p>
<p>Luria is a noble Moor who commands the armies of Florence
against Pisa, and conquers Pisa. He is in love with the city of
Florence as a man is with a woman. Its beauty, history, great men,
and noble buildings attract his Eastern nature, by their Northern
qualities, as much as they repel his friend and countryman Husain.
He lives for her with unbroken faithfulness, and he dies for her
with piteous tenderness when he finds out that Florence distrusts
him. When he is suspected of treachery, his heart breaks, and to
explain his broken heart, he dies. There is no other way left to
show to Florence that he has always been true to her. And at the
moment of his death, all who spied on him, distrusted and condemned
him, are convinced of his fidelity. Even before he dies, his
devotion to his ideal aim, his absolute unselfishness, have won
over and ennobled all the self-interested characters which surround
him&mdash;Puccio, the general who is jealous of him; Domizia, the
woman who desires to use him as an instrument of her hate to
Florence; even Braccio, the Macchiavellian Florentine who thinks
his success must be dangerous to the state. Luria conquers them
all. It is the triumph of self-forgetfulness. And the real aim of
the play is not dramatic. It is too isolated an aim to be dramatic.
It is to build up and image the noble character of Luria, and it
reaches that end with dignity.</p>
<p>The other characters are but foils to enhance the <a name=
'Page238' id="Page238"></a><span class='pagenum'>238</span>solitary
greatness of Luria. Braccio is a mere voice, a theory who talks,
and, at the end, when he becomes more human, he seems to lose his
intelligence. The Secretaries have no individuality. Domizia causes
nothing, and might with advantage be out of the play. However,
when, moved by the nobleness of Luria, she gives up her revenge on
Florence, she speaks well, and her outburst is poetical. Puccio is
a real personage, but a poor fellow. Tiburzio is a pale reflection
of Luria. Husain alone has some personality, but even his
Easternness, which isolates him, is merged in his love of Luria.
All of them only exist to be the scaffolding by means of which
Luria's character is built into magnificence, and they disappear
from our sight, like scaffolding, when the building is
finished.</p>
<p>There are fine things in the poem: the image of Florence; its
men, its streets, its life as seen by the stranger-eyes of Luria;
the contrast between the Eastern and the Latin nature; the picture
of hot war; the sudden friendship of Luria and Tiburzio, the
recognition in a moment of two high hearts by one another; the
picture of Tiburzio fighting at the ford, of Luria tearing the
letter among the shamed conspirators; the drawing of the rough
honest soldier-nature in Puccio, and, chief of all, the vivid
historic painting of the time and the type of Italian character at
the time of the republics.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>The first part of <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i> is written in poetry
and the second in prose. The first part is dull but the second is
very lively and amusing; so gay and clever that we begin to wish
that a <a name='Page239' id="Page239"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>239</span>good deal of Browning's dramas had been written
in prose. And the prose itself, unlike his more serious prose in
his letters and essays, is good, clear, and of an excellent style.
The time of the play is in the sixteenth century; but there is
nothing in it which is special to that time: no scenery, no vivid
pictures of street life, no distinct atmosphere of the period. It
might just as well be of the eighteenth or nineteenth century. The
character of Chiappino may be found in any provincial town. This
compound of envy, self-conceit, superficial cleverness and real
silliness is one of our universal plagues, and not uncommon among
the demagogues of any country. And he contrasts him with Ogniben,
the Pope's legate, another type, well known in governments, skilled
in affairs, half mocking, half tolerant of the "foolish people,"
the alluring destroyer of all self-seeking leaders of the people.
He also is as common as Chiappino, as modern as he is ancient. Both
are representative types, and admirably drawn. They are done at too
great length, but Browning could not manage them as well in Drama
as he would have done in a short piece such as he placed in <i>Men
and Women</i>. Why this little thing is called <i>A Soul's
Tragedy</i> I cannot quite understand. That title supposes that
Chiappino loses his soul at the end of the play. But it is plain
from his mean and envious talk at the beginning with Eulalia that
his soul is already lost. He is not worse at the end, but perhaps
on the way to betterment. The tragedy is then in the discovery by
the people that he who was thought to be a great soul is a fraud.
But that conclusion was not Browning's intention. Finally, if this
be <a name='Page240' id="Page240"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>240</span>a tragedy it is clothed with comedy. Browning's
humour was never more wise, kindly, worldly and biting than in the
second act, and Ogniben may well be set beside Bishop Blougram. It
would be a privilege to dine with either of them.</p>
<p>Every one is in love with <i>Pippa Passes</i>, which appeared
immediately after <i>Sordello</i>. It may have been a refreshment
to Browning after the complexities and metaphysics of
<i>Sordello</i>, to live for a time with the soft simplicity of
Pippa, with the clear motives of the separate occurrences at Asolo,
with the outside picturesque world, and in a lyric atmosphere. It
certainly is a refreshment to us. It is a pity so little was done
by Browning in this pleasant, graceful, happy way. The substance of
thought in it and its intellectual force are just as strong as in
<i>Sordello</i> or <i>Paracelsus</i>, and are concerned, especially
in the first two pieces, with serious and weighty matters of human
life. Beyond the pleasure the poem gives, its indirect teaching is
full of truth and beauty; and the things treated of belong to many
phases of human life, and touch their problems with poetic light
and love. Pippa herself, in her affectionate, natural goodness,
illuminates the greater difficulties of life in a single day more
than Sordello or Paracelsus could in the whole course of their
lives.</p>
<p>It may be that there are persons who think lightly of <i>Pippa
Passes</i> in comparison with <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>, persons
who judge poetry by the difficulties they find in its perusal. But
<i>Pippa Passes</i> fulfils the demands of the art of poetry, and
produces in the world the high results of lovely and noble poetry.
The other only does these things in part; <a name='Page241' id=
"Page241"></a><span class='pagenum'>241</span>and when <i>Fifine at
the Fair</i> and even <i>Sordello</i> are in the future only the
study of pedants, <i>Pippa Passes</i> will be an enduring strength
and pleasure to all who love tenderly and think widely. And those
portions of it which belong to Pippa herself, the most natural,
easy and simplest portions, will be the sources of the greatest
pleasure and the deepest thought. Like Sordello's song, they will
endure for the healing, comforting, exalting and impelling of the
world.</p>
<p>I have written of her and of other parts of the poem elsewhere.
It only remains to say that nowhere is the lyric element in
Browning's genius more delightfully represented than in this little
piece of mingled song and action. There is no better love-lyric in
his work than</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>You'll love me yet!&mdash;and I can tarry</p>
<p class='i2'>Your love's protracted growing;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and the two snatches of song which Pippa sings when she is
passing under Ottima's window and the Monsignore's&mdash;"The
year's at the spring" and "Overhead the tree-tops
meet"&mdash;possess, independent of the meaning of the words and
their poetic charm, a freshness, dewiness, morning ravishment to
which it is difficult to find an equal. They are filled with youth
and its delight, alike of the body and the soul. What Browning's
spirit felt and lived when he was young and his heart beating with
the life of the universe, is in them, and it is their greatest
charm.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3><i>POEMS OF THE PASSION OF LOVE</i></h3>
<p>When we leave <i>Paracelsus, Sordello</i> and the <i>Dramas</i>
behind, and find ourselves among the host of occasional poems
contained in the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> and <i>Romances</i>, in
<i>Men and Women</i>, in <i>Dramatis Person&aelig;</i>, and in the
later volumes, it is like leaving an unencumbered sea for one
studded with a thousand islands. Every island is worth a visit and
different from the rest. Their variety, their distinct scenery,
their diverse inhabitants, the strange surprises in them, are as
continual an enchantment for the poetic voyager as the summer isles
of the Pacific. But while each of them is different from the rest,
yet, like the islands in the Pacific, they fall into groups; and to
isolate these groups is perhaps the best way to treat so varied a
collection of poems. To treat them chronologically would be a task
too long and wearisome for a book. To treat them zoologically, if I
may borrow that term, is possible, and may be profitable. This
chapter is dedicated to the poems which relate to Love.</p>
<p>Commonly speaking, the term <i>Love Poems</i> does not mean
poems concerning the absolute Love, or the love of Ideas, such as
Truth or Beauty, or Love of <a name='Page243' id=
"Page243"></a><span class='pagenum'>243</span>mankind or one's own
country, or the loves that belong to home, or the love of friends,
or even married love unless it be specially bound up, as it is in
Browning's poem of <i>By the Fireside</i>, with ante-nuptial
love&mdash;but poems expressing the isolating passion of one sex
for the other; chiefly in youth, or in conditions which resemble
those of youth, whether moral or immoral. These celebrate the joys
and sorrows, rapture and despair, changes and chances, moods,
fancies, and imaginations, quips and cranks and wanton wiles, all
the tragedy and comedy, of that passion, which is half of the sense
and half of the spirit, sometimes wholly of the senses and
sometimes wholly of the spirit. It began, in one form of it, among
the lower animals and still rules their lives; it has developed
through many thousand years of humanity into myriads of shapes in
and outside of the soul; into stories whose varieties and
multitudes are more numerous than the stars of heaven or the sand
of the seashore; and yet whose multitudinous changes and histories
have their source in two things only&mdash;in the desire to
generate, which is physical; in the desire to forget self in
another, which is spiritual. The union of both these desires into
one passion of thought, act and feeling is the fine quintessence of
this kind of love; but the latter desire alone is the primal motive
of all the other forms of love, from friendship and maternal love
to love of country, of mankind, of ideas, and of God.</p>
<p>With regard to love-poems of the sort we now discuss, the times
in history when they are most written are those in which a nation
or mankind renews its youth. Their production in the days of
<a name='Page244' id="Page244"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>244</span>Elizabeth was enormous, their passion various
and profound, their fancy elaborate, their ornament extravagant
with the extravagance of youth; and, in the hands of the greater
men, their imagination was as fine as their melody. As that age
grew older they were not replaced but were dominated by more
serious subjects; and though love in its fantasies was happily
recorded in song during the Caroline period, passion in English
love-poetry slowly decayed till the ideas of the Revolution, before
the French outbreak, began to renew the youth of the world. The
same career is run by the individual poet. The subject of his youth
is the passion of love, as it was in Browning's <i>Pauline</i>. The
subjects of his manhood are serious with other thought and feeling,
sad with another sadness, happy with another happiness. They
traverse a wider range of human feeling and thought, and when they
speak of love, it is of love in its wiser, steadier, graver and
less selfish forms. It was so with Browning, who far sooner than
his comrades, escaped from the tangled wilderness of youthful
passion. It is curious to think that so young a creature as he was
in 1833 should have left the celebration of the love of woman
behind him, and only written of the love which his
<i>Paracelsus</i> images in Aprile. It seems a little insensitive
in so young a man. But I do not think Browning was ever quite young
save at happy intervals; and this falls in with the fact that his
imagination was more intellectual than passionate; that while he
felt love, he also analysed, even dissected it, as he wrote about
it; that it scarcely ever carried him away so far as to make him
forget everything but itself. Perhaps once or twice, as <a name=
'Page245' id="Page245"></a><span class='pagenum'>245</span>in
<i>The Last Ride Together</i>, he may have drawn near to this
absorption, but even then the man is thinking more of his own
thoughts than of the woman by his side, who must have been somewhat
wearied by so silent a companion. Even in <i>By the Fireside</i>,
when he is praising the wife whom he loved with all his soul, and
recalling the moment of early passion while yet they looked on one
another and felt their souls embrace before they spoke&mdash;it is
curious to find him deviating from the intensity of the
recollection into a discussion of what might have been if she had
not been what she was&mdash;a sort of <i>excursus</i> on the
chances of life which lasts for eight verses&mdash;before he
returns to that immortal moment. Even after years of married life,
a poet, to whom passion has been in youth supreme, would scarcely
have done that. On the whole, his poetry, like that of Wordsworth,
but not so completely, is destitute of the love-poem in the
ordinary sense of the word; and the few exceptions to which we
might point want so much that exclusiveness of a lover which shuts
out all other thought but that of the woman, that it is difficult
to class them in that species of literature. However, this is not
altogether true, and the main exception to it is a curious-piece of
literary and personal history. Those who read <i>Asolando</i>, the
last book of poems he published, were surprised to find with what
intensity some of the first poems in it described the passion of
sexual love. They are fully charged with isolated emotion; other
thoughts than those of love do not intrude upon them. Moreover,
they have a sincere lyric note. It is impossible, unless by a
miracle of imagination, that <a name='Page246' id=
"Page246"></a><span class='pagenum'>246</span>these could have been
written when he was about eighty years of age. I believe, though I
do not know, that he wrote them when he was quite a young man; that
he found them on looking over his portfolios, and had a dim and
scented pleasure in reading and publishing them in his old age. He
mentions in the preface that the book contains both old and new
poems. The new are easily isolated, and the first poem, the
introduction to the collection, is of the date of the book. The
rest belong to different periods of his life. The four poems to
which I refer are <i>Now, Summum Bonum, A Pearl&mdash;A Girl</i>,
and <i>Speculative</i>. They are beautiful with a beauty of their
own; full of that natural abandonment of the whole world for one
moment with the woman loved, which youth and the hours of youth in
manhood feel. I should have been sorry if Browning had not shaped
into song this abandonment. He loved the natural, and was convinced
of its rightness; and he had, as I might prove, a tenderness for it
even when it passed into wrong. He was the last man in the world to
think that the passion of noble sexual love was to be despised. And
it is pleasant to find, at the end of his long poetic career, that,
in a serious and wise old age, he selected, to form part of his
last book, poems of youthful and impassioned love, in which the
senses and the spirit met, each in their pre-eminence.</p>
<p>The two first of these, <i>Now</i> and <i>Summum Bonum</i>, must
belong to his youth, though from certain turns of expression and
thought in them, it seems that Browning worked on them at the time
he published them. I quote the second for its lyric charm, even
though the melody is ruthlessly broken,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page247' id="Page247"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>247</p>
<p>All the breath and the bloom of the year in the bag of one

<p>Brightest truth, purest trust in the universe&mdash;all were for
me</p>
<p class='i6'>In the kiss of one girl.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The next two poems are knit to this and to <i>Now</i> by the
strong emotion of earthly love, of the senses as well as of the
spirit, for one woman; but they differ in the period at which they
were written. The first, <i>A Pearl&mdash;A Girl</i>, recalls that
part of the poem <i>By the Fireside</i>, when one look, one word,
opened the infinite world of love to Browning. If written when he
was young, it has been revised in after life.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A simple ring with a single stone</p>
<p class='i2'>To the vulgar eye no stone of price:</p>
<p>Whisper the right word, that alone&mdash;</p>

<p class='i2'>Through the power in a pearl.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>

<p>Lord whole and sole&mdash;by a minute's birth&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'>Through the love in a girl!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The second&mdash;<i>Speculative</i>&mdash;also describes a
moment of love-longing, but has the characteristics of his later
poetry. It may be of the same date as the book, or not much
earlier. It may be of his <a name='Page248' id=
"Page248"></a><span class='pagenum'>248</span>later manhood, of the
time when he lost his wife. At any rate, it is intense enough. It
looks back on the love he has lost, on passion with the woman he
loved. And he would surrender all&mdash;Heaven, Nature, Man,
Art&mdash;in this momentary fire of desire; for indeed such passion
is momentary. Momentariness is the essence of the poem. "Even in
heaven I will cry for the wild hours now gone by&mdash;Give me back
the Earth and Thyself." <i>Speculative</i>, he calls it, in an
after irony.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>

<p>I shall pray: "Fugitive as precious&mdash;</p>

<p class='i2'>You with old pleasure, me&mdash;old pain,</p>
<p class='i2'>So we but meet nor part again!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Nor was this reversion to the passion of youthful love
altogether a new departure. The lyrics in <i>Ferishtah's
Fancies</i> are written to represent, from the side of emotion, the
intellectual and ethical ideas worked out in the poems. The greater
number of them are beautiful, and they would gain rather than lose
if they were published separately from the poems. Some are plainly
of the same date as the poems. Others, I think, were written in
Browning's early time, and the preceding poems are made to fit
them. But whatever be their origin, they nearly all treat of love,
and one of them with a crude claim on the love of the senses alone,
as if that&mdash;as if the love of the body, even alone&mdash;were
<a name='Page249' id="Page249"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>249</span>not apart from the consideration of a poet who
wished to treat of the whole of human nature. Browning, when he
wished to make a thought or a fact quite plain, frequently stated
it without any of its modifications, trusting to his readers not to
mistake him; knowing indeed, that if they cared to find the other
side&mdash;in this case the love which issues from the senses and
the spirit together, or from the spirit alone&mdash;they would find
it stated just as soundly and clearly. He meant us to combine both
statements, and he has done so himself with regard to love.</p>
<p>When, however, we have considered these exceptions, it still
remains curious how little the passionate Love-poem, with its
strong personal touch, exists in Browning's poetry. One reason may
be that Love-poems of this kind are naturally lyrical, and demand a
sweet melody in the verse, and Browning's genius was not especially
lyrical, nor could he inevitably command a melodious movement in
his verse. But the main reason is that he was taken up with other
and graver matters, and chiefly with the right theory of life; with
the true relation of God and man; and with the picturing&mdash;for
absolute Love's sake, and in order to win men to love one another
by the awakening of pity&mdash;of as much of humanity as he could
grasp in thought and feeling. Isolated and personal love was only a
small part of this large design.</p>
<p>One personal love, however, he possessed fully and intensely. It
was his love for his wife, and three poems embody it. The first is
<i>By the Fireside</i>. It does not take rank as a true love lyric;
it is too long, too many-motived for a lyric. It is a <a name=
'Page250' id="Page250"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>250</span>meditative poem of recollective tenderness
wandering through the past; and no poem written on married love in
England is more beautiful. The poet, sitting silent in the room
where his wife sits with him, sees all his life with her unrolled,
muses on what has been, and is, since she came to bless his life,
or what will be, since she continues to bless it; and all the
fancies and musings which, in a usual love lyric, would not
harmonise with the intensity of love-passion in youth, exactly fit
in with the peace and satisfied joy of a married life at home with
God and nature and itself. The poem is full of personal charm.
Quiet thought, profound feeling and sweet memory like a sunlit
mist, soften the aspect of the room, the image of his wife, and all
the thoughts, emotions and scenery described. It is a finished
piece of art.</p>
<p>The second of these poems is the Epilogue to the volumes of
<i>Men and Women</i>, entitled <i>One Word More</i>. It also is a
finished piece of art, carefully conceived, upbuilded stone by
stone, touch by touch, each separate thought with its own emotion,
each adding something to the whole, each pushing Browning's emotion
and picture into our souls, till the whole impression is received.
It is full, and full to the brim, with the long experience of
peaceful joy in married love. And the subtlety of the close of it,
and of Browning's play with his own fancy about the moon, do not
detract from the tenderness of it; for it speaks not of transient
passion but of the love of a whole life lived from end to end in
music.</p>
<p>The last of these is entitled <i>Prospice</i>. When he wrote it
he had lost his wife. It tells what she <a name='Page251' id=
"Page251"></a><span class='pagenum'>251</span>had made of him; it
reveals alike his steadfast sadness that she had gone from him and
the steadfast resolution, due to her sweet and enduring power, with
which, after her death, he promised, bearing with him his sorrow
and his memory of joy, to stand and withstand in the battle of
life, ever a fighter to the close&mdash;and well he kept his word.
It ends with the expression of his triumphant certainty of meeting
her, and breaks forth at last into so great a cry of pure passion
that ear and heart alike rejoice. Browning at his best, Browning in
the central fire of his character, is in it.</p>

</div>
<p><a name='Page252' id="Page252"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>252</span>Leaving now these personal poems on Love, we
come to those we may call impersonal. They are poems about love,
not in its simplicities, but in its subtle moments&mdash;moments
that Browning loved to analyse, and which he informed not so much
with the passion of love, as with his profound love of human
nature. He describes in them, with the seriousness of one who has
left youth behind, the moods of love, its changes, vagaries,
certainties, failures and conquests. It is a man writing, not of
the love of happy youth, but of love tossed on the stormy seas of
manhood and womanhood, and modified from its singular personal
intensity by the deeper thought, feeling and surprising chances of
our mortal life. Love does not stand alone, as in the true love
lyric, but with many other grave matters. As such it is a more
interesting subject for Browning. For Love then becomes full of
strange turns, unexpected thoughts, impulses unknown before
creating varied circumstances, and created by them; and these his
intellectual spirituality delighted to cope with, and to follow,
labyrinth after labyrinth. I shall give examples of these separate
studies, which have always an idea beyond the love out of which the
poem arises. In some of them the love is finally absorbed in the
idea. In all of them their aim is beyond the love of which they
speak.</p>
<p><i>Love among the Ruins</i> tells of a lover going to meet his
sweetheart. There are many poems with this expectant motive in the
world of song, and no motive has been written of with greater
emotion. If we are to believe these poems, or have ever waited
ourselves, the hour contains nothing but her <a name='Page253' id=
"Page253"></a><span class='pagenum'>253</span>presence, what she is
doing, how she is coming, why she delays, what it will be when she
comes&mdash;a thousand things, each like white fire round her
image. But Browning's lover, through nine verses, cares only for
the wide meadows over which he makes his way and the sheep
wandering over them, and their flowers and the ruins in the midst
of them; musing on the changes and contrasts of the world&mdash;the
lonely land and the populous glory which was of old in the vast
city. It is only then, and only in two lines, that he thinks of the
girl who is waiting for him in the ruined tower. Even then his
imagination cannot stay with her, but glances from her
instantly&mdash;thinking that the ancient king stood where she is
waiting, and looked, full of pride, from the high tower on his
splendid city. When he has elaborated this second excursion of
thought he comes at last to the girl. Then is the hour of passion,
but even in its fervour he draws a conclusion, belonging to a
higher world than youthful love, as remote from it as his
description of the scenery and the ruins. "Splendour of arms,
triumph of wealth, centuries of glory and pride, they are nothing
to love. Love is best." It is a general, not a particular
conclusion. In a true Love-poem it would be particular.</p>
<p>Another poem of waiting love is <i>In Three Days</i>. And this
has the spirit of a true love lyric in it. It reads like a personal
thing; it breathes exaltation; it is quick, hurried, and thrilled.
The delicate fears of chance and change in the three days, or in
the years to come, belong of right and nature to the waiting, and
are subtly varied and condensed. It is, however, the thoughtful
love of a <a name='Page254' id="Page254"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>254</span>man who can be metaphysical in love, not the
excluding mastery of passion.</p>
<p><i>Two in the Campagna</i> is another poem in which love passes
away into a deeper thought than love&mdash;a strange and
fascinating poem of twofold desire. The man loves a woman and
desires to be at peace with her in love, but there is a more
imperative passion in his soul&mdash;to rest in the infinite, in
accomplished perfection. And his livelong and vain pursuit of this
has wearied him so much that he has no strength left to realise
earthly love. Is it possible that she who now walks with him in the
Campagna can give him in her love the peace of the infinite which
he desires, and if not, why&mdash;where is the fault? For a moment
he seems to catch the reason, and asks his love to see it with him
and to grasp it. In a moment, like the gossamer thread he traces
only to see it vanish, it is gone&mdash;and nothing is left,
save</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Infinite passion, and the pain</p>
<p>Of finite hearts that yearn.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Least of all is the woman left. She has quite disappeared. This
is not a Love-poem at all, it is the cry of Browning's hunger for
eternity in the midst of mortality, in which all the hunger for
earthly love is burnt to dust.</p>
<p>The rest are chiefly studies of different kinds of love, or of
crises in love; moments in its course, in its origin or its
failure. There are many examples in the shorter dramatic pieces, as
<i>In a Balcony</i>; and even in the longer dramas certain sharp
climaxes of love are recorded, not as if they belonged to the
drama, but as if they were distinct studies introduced by chance or
caprice. In the <a name='Page255' id="Page255"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>255</span>short poems called "dramatic" these studies are
numerous, and I group a few of them together according to their
motives, leaving out some which I shall hereafter treat of when I
come to discuss the women in Browning. <i>Evelyn Hope</i> has
nothing to do with the passion of love. The physical element of
love is entirely excluded by the subject. It is a beautiful
expression of a love purely spiritual, to be realised in its
fulness only after death, spirit with spirit, but yet to be kept as
the master of daily life, to whose law all thought and action are
referred. The thought is noble, the expression of it simple, fine,
and clear. It is, moreover, close to truth&mdash;there are hundreds
of men who live quietly in love of that kind, and die in its
embrace.</p>
<p>In <i>Cristina</i> the love is just as spiritual, but the motive
of the poem is not one, as in <i>Evelyn Hope</i>, but two. The
woman is not dead, and she has missed her chance. But the lover has
not. He has seen her and in a moment loved her. She also looked on
him and felt her soul matched by his as they "rushed together." But
the world carried her away and she lost the fulness of life. He, on
the contrary, kept the moment for ever, and with it, her and all
she might have been with him.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Her soul's mine: and thus grown perfect,</p>
<p>I shall pass my life's remainder.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is not the usual Love-poem. It is a love as spiritual, as
mystic, even more mystic, since the woman lives, than the lover
felt for Evelyn Hope.</p>
<p>The second motive in <i>Cristina</i> of the lover who meets the
true partner of his soul or hers, and either seizes the happy hour
and possesses joy for ever, or misses it and loses all, is a
favourite with <a name='Page256' id="Page256"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>256</span>Browning. He repeats it frequently under
diverse circumstances, for it opened out so many various endings,
and afforded so much opportunity for his beloved analysis.
Moreover, optimist as he was in his final thought of man, he was
deeply conscious of the ironies of life, of the ease with which
things go wrong, of the impossibility of setting them right from
without. And in the matter of love he marks in at least four poems
how the moment was held and life was therefore conquest. Then in
<i>Youth and Art</i>, in <i>Dis Aliter Visum</i>, in
<i>Bifurcation</i>, in <i>The Lost Mistress</i>, and in <i>Too
Late</i>, he records the opposite fate, and in characters so
distinct that the repetition of the motive is not monotonous. These
are studies of the Might-have-beens of love.</p>
<p>Another motive, used with varied circumstance in three or four
poems, but fully expanded in <i>James Lee's Wife</i>, is the
discovery, after years of love, that love on one side is lost
irretrievably. Another motive is, that rather than lose love men or
women will often sacrifice their conscience, their reason, or their
liberty. This sacrifice, of all that makes our nobler being for the
sake of personal love alone, brings with it, because the whole
being is degraded, the degradation, decay, and death of personal
love itself.</p>
<p>Another set of poems describes with fanciful charm, sometimes
with happy gaiety, love at play with itself. True love makes in the
soul an unfathomable ocean in whose depths are the imaginations of
love, serious, infinite, and divine. But on its surface the light
of jewelled fancies plays&mdash;a thousand thousand sunny memories
and hopes, <a name='Page257' id="Page257"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>257</span>flying thoughts and dancing feelings. A poet
would be certain to have often seen this happy crowd, and to desire
to trick them out in song. So Browning does in his poem, <i>In a
Gondola</i>. The two lovers, with the dark shadow of fate brooding
over them, sing and muse and speak alternately, imaging in swift
and rival pictures made by fancy their deep-set love; playing with
its changes, creating new worlds in which to place it, but always
returning to its isolated individuality; recalling how it began,
the room where it reached its aim, the pictures, the furniture, the
balcony, her dress, all the scenery, in a hundred happy and
glancing pictures; while interlaced through their gaiety&mdash;and
the gaiety made keener by the nearness of dark fate&mdash;is coming
death, death well purchased by an hour of love. Finally, the lover
is stabbed and slain, and the pity of it throws back over the
sunshine of love's fancies a cloud of tears. This is the stuff of
life that Browning loved to paint&mdash;interwoven darkness and
brightness, sorrow and joy trembling each on the edge of the other,
life playing at ball, as joyous as Nausicaa and her maids, on a
thin crust over a gulf of death.</p>
<p>Just such another poem&mdash;of the sportiveness of love, only
this time in memory, not in present pleasure, is to be found in
<i>A Lovers' Quarrel</i>, and the quarrel is the dark element in
it. Browning always feels that mighty passion has its root in
tragedy, and that it seeks relief in comedy. The lover sits by the
fireside alone, and recalls, forgetting pain for a moment, the
joyful play they two had together, when love expressed its depth of
pleasure in dramatic fancies. Every separate picture is done
<a name='Page258' id="Page258"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>258</span>in Browning's impressionist way. And when the
glad memories are over, and the sorrow returns, passion leaps
out&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>It is twelve o'clock:</p>
<p class='i2'>I shall hear her knock</p>
<p>In the worst of a storm's uproar,</p>
<p class='i2'>I shall pull her through the door,</p>
<p>I shall have her for evermore!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is partly a study of the memory of love; and Browning has
represented, without any sorrow linked to it, memorial love in a
variety of characters under different circumstances, so that,
though the subject is the same, the treatment varies. A charming
instance of this is <i>The Flowers Name</i>; easy to read, happy in
its fancy, in its scenery, in the subtle play of deep affection, in
the character of its lover, in the character of the girl who is
remembered&mdash;a good example of Browning's power to image in a
few verses two human souls so clearly that they live in our world
for ever. <i>Meeting at Night&mdash;Parting at Morning</i> is
another reminiscence, mixed up with the natural scenery of the
meeting and parting, a vivid recollection of a fleeting night of
passion, and then the abandonment of its isolation for a wider,
fuller life with humanity. I quote it for the fine impassioned way
in which human feeling and natural scenery are fused together.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>MEETING AT NIGHT.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The grey sea and the long black land;</p>
<p class='i2'>And the yellow half-moon large and low;</p>
<p>And the startled little waves that leap</p>
<p>In fiery ringlets from their sleep,</p>
<p class='i2'>As I gain the cove with pushing prow.</p>
<p>And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.</p>
<a name='Page259' id="Page259"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>259</p>
<p>Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;</p>
<p class='i2'>Three fields to cross till a farm appears;</p>
<p>A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch</p>
<p>And blue spurt of a lighted match,</p>
<p class='i2'>And a voice less loud, through its joys and
fears.</p>
<p>Than the two hearts beating each to each!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>PARTING AT MORNING.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Round the cape of a sudden came the sea,</p>
<p class='i2'>And the sun looked over the mountain's rim:</p>
<p class='i2'>And straight was a path of gold for him,</p>
<p>And the need of a world of men for me.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poem entitled <i>Confessions</i> is another of these
memories, in which a dying man, careless of death, careless of the
dull conventions of the clergyman, cares for nothing but the memory
of his early passion for a girl one happy June, and dies in comfort
of the sweetness of the memory, though he thinks&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>How sad and bad and mad it was.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Few but Browning would have seen, and fewer still have recorded,
this vital piece of truth. It represents a whole type of
character&mdash;those who in a life of weary work keep their day of
love, even when it has been wrong, as their one poetic, ideal
possession, and cherish it for ever. The wrong of it disappears in
the ideal beauty which now has gathered round it, and as it was
faithful, unmixed with other love, it escapes degradation. We see,
when the man images the past and its scenery out of the bottles of
physic on the table, how the material world had been idealised to
him all his life long by this passionate memory&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Do I view the world as a vale of tears?</p>
<p class='i2'>Ah, reverend sir, not I.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page260' id="Page260"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>260</span>It might be well to compare with this another
treatment of the memory of love in <i>St. Martin's Summer</i>. A
much less interesting and natural motive rules it than
<i>Confessions</i>; and the characters, though more "in society"
than the dying man, are grosser in nature; gross by their inability
to love, or by loving freshly to make a new world in which the old
sorrow dies or is transformed. There is no humour in the thing,
though there is bitter irony. But there is humour in an earlier
poem&mdash;<i>A Serenade at the Villa</i>, where, in the last
verse, the bitterness of wrath and love together (a very different
bitterness from that of <i>St. Martin's Summer</i>), breaks out,
and is attributed to the garden gate. The night-watch and the
singing is over; she must have heard him, but she gave no sign. He
wonders what she thought, and then, because he was only half in
love, flings away&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh how dark your villa was,</p>
<p class='i2'>Windows fast and obdurate!</p>
<p>How the garden grudged me grass</p>
<p class='i2'>Where I stood&mdash;the iron gate</p>
<p>Ground its teeth to let me pass!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is impossible to notice all these studies of love, but they
form, together, a book of transient phases of the passion in almost
every class of society. And they show how Browning, passing through
the world, from the Quartier Latin to London drawing-rooms, was
continually on the watch to catch, store up, and reproduce a crowd
of motives for poetry which his memory held and his imagination
shaped.</p>
<p>There is only one more poem, which I cannot pass by in this
group of studies. It is one of <a name='Page261' id=
"Page261"></a><span class='pagenum'>261</span>sacred and personal
memory, so much so that it is probable the loss of his life lies
beneath it. It rises into that highest poetry which fuses together
into one form a hundred thoughts and a hundred emotions, and which
is only obscure from the mingling of their multitude. I quote it, I
cannot comment on it.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i4'>Never the time and the place</p>
<p class='i6'>And the loved one all together!</p>
<p class='i4'>This path&mdash;how soft to pace!</p>
<p class='i6'>This May&mdash;what magic weather!</p>
<p class='i4'>Where is the loved one's face?</p>
<p>In a dream that loved one's face meets mine</p>
<p class='i2'>But the house is narrow, the place is bleak</p>
<p>Where, outside, rain and wind combine</p>
<p class='i2'>With a furtive ear, if I strive to speak,</p>
<p class='i2'>With a hostile eye at my flushing cheek,</p>
<p>With a malice that marks each word, each sign!</p>
<p class='i4'>O enemy sly and serpentine,</p>
<p class='i4'>Uncoil thee from the waking man!</p>
<p class='i6'>Do I hold the Past</p>
<p class='i6'>Thus firm and fast</p>
<p class='i4'>Yet doubt if the Future hold I can?</p>
<p class='i2'>This path so soft to pace shall lead</p>
<p class='i2'>Through the magic of May to herself indeed!</p>
<p class='i2'>Or narrow if needs the house must be,</p>
<p class='i2'>Outside are the storms and strangers: we&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'>Oh, close, safe, warm sleep I and she,</p>
<p class='i1'>&mdash;I and she!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That, indeed, is passionate enough.</p>
<p>Then there is another group&mdash;tales which embody phases of
love. <i>Count Gismond</i> is one of these. It is too long, and
wants Browning's usual force. The outline of the story was,
perhaps, too simple to interest his intellect, and he needed in
writing poetry not only the emotional subject, but that there
should be something in or behind the <a name='Page262' id=
"Page262"></a><span class='pagenum'>262</span>emotion through the
mazes of which his intelligence might glide like a serpent.<a name=
'FNanchor_10_10' id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href=
'#Footnote_10_10'>[10]</a></p>
<p><i>The Glove</i> is another of these tales&mdash;a good example
of the brilliant fashion in which Browning could, by a strange
kaleidoscopic turn of his subject, give it a new aspect and a new
ending. The world has had the tale before it for a very long time.
Every one had said the woman was wrong and the man right; but here,
poetic juggler as he is, Browning makes the woman right and the man
wrong, reversing the judgment of centuries. The best of it is, that
he seems to hold the truth of the thing. It is amusing to think
that only now, in the other world, if she and Browning meet, will
she find herself comprehended.</p>
<p>Finally, as to the mightier kinds of love, those supreme forms
of the passion, which have neither beginning nor end; to which time
and space are but names; which make and fill the universe; the
least grain of which predicates the whole; the spirit of which is
God Himself; the breath of whose life is immortal joy, or sorrow
which means joy; whose vision is Beauty, and whose activity is
Creation&mdash;these, united in God, or divided among men into
their three great entities&mdash;love of ideas for their truth and
beauty; love of the natural universe, which is God's garment; love
of humanity, which is God's child&mdash;these pervade the whole of
Browning's poetry as the heat of the sun pervades the earth and
every little grain upon it. They make its warmth <a name='Page263'
id="Page263"></a><span class='pagenum'>263</span>and life, strength
and beauty. They are too vast to be circumscribed in a lyric,
represented in a drama, bound up even in a long story of spiritual
endeavour like <i>Paracelsus</i>. But they move, in dignity,
splendour and passion, through all that he deeply conceived and
nobly wrought; and their triumph and immortality in his poetry are
never for one moment clouded with doubt or subject to death. This
is the supreme thing in his work. To him Love is the Conqueror, and
Love is God.</p>
<p><a name='Page264' id="Page264"></a><span class=

<div class='footnote'>
<p><a name='Footnote_10_10' id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href=
'#FNanchor_10_10'>[10]</a> There is one simple story at least which
he tells quite admirably, <i>The Pied Piper of Hamelin</i>. But
then, that story, if it is not troubled by intellectual matter, is
also not troubled by any deep emotion. It is told by a poet who
becomes a child for children.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_X' id="CHAPTER_X"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3><i>THE PASSIONS OTHER THAN LOVE</i></h3>
<p>The poems on which I have dwelt in the last chapter, though they
are mainly concerned with love between the sexes, illustrate the
other noble passions, all of which, such as joy, are forms of, or
rather children of, self-forgetful love. They do not illustrate the
evil or ignoble passions&mdash;envy, jealousy, hatred, base fear,
despair, revenge, avarice and remorse&mdash;which, driven by the
emotion that so fiercely and swiftly accumulates around them,
master the body and soul, the intellect and the will, like some
furious tyrant, and in their extremes hurry their victim into
madness. Browning took some of these terrible powers and made them
subjects in his poetry. Short, sharp-outlined sketches of them
occur in his dramas and longer poems. There is no closer image in
literature of long-suppressed fear breaking out into its agony of
despair than in the lines which seal Guido's pleading in the <i>The
Ring and the Book</i>.</p>
<div class='poem'>

</div>
<p><a name='Page265' id="Page265"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>265</span>But there is no elaborate, long-continued study
of these sordid and evil things in Browning. He was not one of our
modern realists who love to paddle and splash in the sewers of
humanity. Not only was he too healthy in mind to dwell on them, but
he justly held them as not fit subjects for art unless they were
bound up with some form of pity, as jealousy and envy are in
Shakespeare's treatment of the story of Othello; or imaged along
with so much of historic scenery that we lose in our interest in
the decoration some of the hatefulness of the passion. The
combination, for example, of envy and hatred resolved on vengeance
in <i>The Laboratory</i> is too intense for any pity to intrude,
but Browning realises not only the evil passions in the woman but
the historical period also and its temper; and he fills the poem
with scenery which, though it leaves the woman first in our eyes,
yet lessens the malignant element. The same, but of course with the
difference Browning's variety creates, may be said of the story of
the envious king, where envy crawls into hatred, hatred almost
motiveless&mdash;the <i>Instans Tyrannus</i>. A faint vein of
humour runs through it. The king describes what has been; his
hatred has passed. He sees how small and fanciful it was, and the
illustrations he uses to express it tell us that; though they carry
with them also the contemptuous intensity of his past hatred. The
swell of the hatred remains, though the hatred is past. So we are
not left face to face with absolute evil, with the corruption hate
engenders in the soul. God has intervened, and the worst of it has
passed away.</p>
<p>Then there is the study of hatred in the <i>Soliloquy <a name=
'Page266' id="Page266"></a><span class='pagenum'>266</span>of the
Spanish Cloister</i>. The hatred is black and deadly, the
instinctive hatred of a brutal nature for a delicate one, which,
were it unrelieved, would be too vile for the art of poetry. But it
is relieved, not only by the scenery, the sketch of the monks in
the refectory, the garden of flowers, the naughty girls seated on
the convent bank washing their black hair, but also by the
admirable humour which ripples like laughter through the hopes of
his hatred, and by the brilliant sketching of the two men. We see
them, know them, down to their little tricks at dinner, and we end
by realising hatred, it is true, but in too agreeable a fashion for
just distress.</p>
<p>In other poems of the evil passions the relieving element is
pity. There are the two poems entitled <i>Before</i> and
<i>After</i>, that is, before and after the duel. <i>Before</i> is
the statement of one of the seconds, with curious side-thoughts
introduced by Browning's mental play with the subject, that the
duel is absolutely necessary. The challenger has been deeply
wronged; and he cannot and will not let forgiveness intermit his
vengeance. The man in us agrees with that; the Christian in us
says, "Forgive, let God do the judgment." But the passion for
revenge has here its way and the guilty falls. And now let Browning
speak&mdash;Forgiveness is right and the vengeance-fury wrong. The
dead man has escaped, the living has not escaped the wrath of
conscience; pity is all.</p>
<div class='poem'>

</div>

</div>
</div>
<p>Again, there are few studies in literature of contempt, hatred
and revenge more sustained and subtle than Browning's poem entitled
<i>A Forgiveness</i>; and the title marks how, though the justice
of revenge was accomplished on the woman, yet that pity, even love
for her, accompanied and followed the revenge. Our natural revolt
against the cold-blooded work of hatred is modified, when we see
the man's heart and the woman's soul, into pity for their fate. The
man tells his story to a monk in the confessional, who has been the
lover of his wife. He is a statesman absorbed in his work, yet he
feels that his wife makes his home a heaven, and he carries her
presence with him all the day. His wife takes the first lover she
meets, and, discovered, tells her husband that she hates him. "Kill
me now," she cries. But he despises her too much to hate her; she
is not worth killing. Three years they live together in that
fashion, till one evening she tells him the truth. "I was jealous
of your work. I took my revenge by taking a lover, but I loved you,
you only, all the time, and lost you&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page268' id="Page268"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>268</p>
<p class='i12'>I thought you gave</p>
<p>Your heart and soul away from me to slave</p>
<p>At statecraft. Since my right in you seemed lost,</p>
<p>I stung myself to teach you, to your cost,</p>
<p>What you rejected could be prized beyond</p>
<p>Life, heaven, by the first fool I threw a fond</p>
<p>Look on, a fatal word to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"Ah, is that true, you loved and still love? Then contempt
perishes, and hate takes its place. Write your confession, and die
by my hand. Vengeance is foreign to contempt, you have risen to the
level at which hate can act. I pardon you, for as I slay hate
departs&mdash;and now, sir," and he turns to the monk&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>She sleeps, as erst</p>
<p>Beloved, in this your church: ay, yours!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and drives the poisoned dagger through the grate of the
confessional into the heart of her lover.</p>
<p>This is Browning's closest study of hate, contempt, and revenge.
But bitter and close as it is, what is left with us is pity for
humanity, pity for the woman, pity for the lover, pity for the
husband.</p>
<p>Again, in the case of Sebald and Ottima in <i>Pippa Passes</i>,
pity also rules. Love passing into lust has led to hate, and these
two have slaked their hate and murdered Luca, Ottima's husband.
They lean out of the window of the shrub-house as the morning
breaks. For the moment their false love is supreme. Their crime
only creeps like a snake, half asleep, about the bottom of their
hearts; they recall their early passion and try to brazen it forth
in the face of their murder, which now rises, dreadful and more
dreadful, into threatening life in their soul. They reanimate their
hate of Luca to <a name='Page269' id="Page269"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>269</span>lower their remorse, but at every instant his
blood stains their speech. At last, while Ottima loves on, Sebald's
dark horror turns to hatred of her he loved, till she lures him
back into desire of her again. The momentary lust cannot last, but
Browning shoots it into prominence that the outburst of horror and
repentance may be the greater.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I kiss you now, dear Ottima, now and now!</p>
<p>This way? Will you forgive me&mdash;be once more</p>
<p>My great queen?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>At that moment Pippa passes by, singing:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The year's at the spring</p>
<p>And day's at the morn;</p>
<p>Morning's at seven;</p>
<p>The hill-side's dew-pearled;</p>
<p>The lark's on the wing;</p>
<p>The snail's on the thorn;</p>
<p>God's in his heaven&mdash;</p>
<p>All's right with the world!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Something in it smites Sebald's heart like a hammer of God. He
repents, but in the cowardice of repentance curses her. That
baseness I do not think Browning should have introduced, no, nor
certain carnal phrases which, previously right, now jar with the
spiritual passion of repentance. But his fury with her passes away
into the passion of despair&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>My brain is drowned now&mdash;quite drowned: all I feel</p>
<p>Is ... is, at swift recurring intervals,</p>
<p>A hurry-down within me, as of waters</p>
<p>Loosened to smother up some ghastly pit:</p>
<p>There they go&mdash;whirls from a black fiery sea!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>lines which must have been suggested to Browning by verses,
briefer and more intense, in Webster's</p>
<p><a name='Page270' id="Page270"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>270</span><i>Duchess of Malfi</i>. Even Ottima, lifted by
her love, which purifies itself in wishing to die for her lover,
repents.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Not me,&mdash;to him, O God, be merciful!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus into this cauldron of sin Browning steals the pity of God.
We know they will be saved, so as by fire.</p>
<p>Then there is the poem on the story of <i>Cristina and
Monaldeschi</i>; a subject too odious, I think, to be treated
lyrically. It is a tale of love turned to hatred, and for good
cause, and of the pitiless vengeance which followed. Browning has
not succeeded in it; and it may be so because he could get no pity
into it. The Queen had none. Monaldeschi deserved none&mdash;a
coward, a fool, and a traitor! Nevertheless, more might have been
made of it by Browning. The poem is obscure and wandering, and the
effort he makes to grip the subject reveals nothing but the
weakness of the grip. It ought not to have been published.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>And now I turn to passions more delightful, that this chapter
may close in light and not in darkness&mdash;passions of the
imagination, of the romantic regions of the soul. There is, first,
the longing for the mystic world, the world beneath appearance,
with or without reference to eternity. Secondly, bound up with
that, there is the longing for the unknown, for following the gleam
which seems to lead us onward, but we know not where. Then, there
is the desire, the deeper for its constant suppression, for escape
from the prison of a worldly society, from its conventions and
maxims <a name='Page271' id="Page271"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>271</span>of morality, its barriers of custom and rule,
into liberty and unchartered life. Lastly, there is that longing to
discover and enjoy the lands of adventure and romance which
underlies and wells upwards through so much of modern life, and
which has never ceased to send its waters up to refresh the world.
These are romantic passions. On the whole, Browning does not often
touch them in their earthly activities. His highest romance was
beyond this world. It claimed eternity, and death was the entrance
into its enchanted realm. When he did bring romantic feeling into
human life, it was for the most part in the hunger and thirst,
which, as in <i>Abt Vogler</i>, urged men beyond the visible into
the invisible. But now and again he touched the Romantic of Earth.
<i>Childe Roland</i>, <i>The Flight of the Duchess</i>, and some
others, are alive with the romantic spirit.</p>
<p>But before I write of these, there are a few lyrical poems,
written in the freshness of his youth, which are steeped in the
light of the story-telling world; and might be made by one who, in
the morning of imagination, sat on the dewy hills of the childish
world. They are full of unusual melody, and are simple and wise
enough to be sung by girls knitting in the sunshine while their
lovers bend above them. One of these, a beautiful thing, with that
touch of dark fate at its close which is so common in folk-stories,
is hidden away in <i>Paracelsus</i>. "Over the sea," it begins:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i2'>Over the sea our galleys went,</p>
<p>With cleaving prows in order brave</p>
<p>To a speeding wind and a bounding wave,</p>
<p class='i2'>A gallant armament:</p>
<a name='Page272' id="Page272"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>272</p>
<p>Each bark built out of a forest-tree</p>
<p class='i2'>Left leafy and rough as first it grew,</p>
<p>And nailed all over the gaping sides,</p>
<p>Within and without, with black bull-hides,</p>
<p>Seethed in fat, and suppled with flame,</p>
<p>To bear the playful billows' game.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is made in a happy melody, and the curious mingling in the
tale, as it continues, of the rudest ships, as described above,
with purple hangings, cedar tents, and noble statues,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A hundred shapes of lucid stone,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and with gentle islanders from Gr&aelig;cian seas, is
characteristic of certain folk-tales, especially those of Gascony.
That it is spoken by Paracelsus as a parable of the state of mind
he has reached, in which he clings to his first fault with haughty
and foolish resolution, scarcely lessens the romantic element in
it. That is so strong that we forget that it is meant as a
parable.</p>
<p>There is another song which touches the edge of romance, in
which Paracelsus describes how he will bury in sweetness the ideal
aims he had in youth, building a pyre for them of all perfumed
things; and the last lines of the verse I quote leave us in a
castle of old romance&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And strew faint sweetness from some old</p>
<p class='i2'>Egyptian's fine worm-eaten shroud</p>
<p>Which breaks to dust when once unrolled;</p>
<p class='i2'>Or shredded perfume, like a cloud</p>
<p>From closet long to quiet vowed,</p>
<p>With mothed and dropping arras hung,</p>
<p>Mouldering her lute and books among,</p>
<p>As when a queen, long dead, was young.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The other is a song, more than a song, in <i>Pippa Passes</i>, a
true piece of early folk-romance, with a <a name='Page273' id=
"Page273"></a><span class='pagenum'>273</span>faint touch of Greek
story, wedded to Eastern and medi&aelig;val elements, in its roving
imaginations. It is admirably pictorial, and the air which broods
over it is the sunny and still air which, in men's fancy, was
breathed by the happy children of the Golden Age. I quote a great
part of it:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A King lived long ago,</p>
<p>In the morning of the world,</p>
<p>When earth was nigher heaven than now:</p>
<p>And the King's locks curled,</p>
<p>Disparting o'er a forehead full</p>
<p>As the milk-white space 'twixt horn and horn</p>
<p>Of some sacrificial bull&mdash;</p>
<p>Only calm as a babe new-born:</p>
<p>For he was got to a sleepy mood,</p>
<p>So safe from all decrepitude,</p>
<p>Age with its bane, so sure gone by,</p>
<p>(The gods so loved him while he dreamed)</p>
<p>That, having lived thus long, there seemed</p>
<p>No need the King should ever die.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>LUIGI. No need that sort of King should ever die!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Among the rocks his city was:</p>
<p>Before his palace, in the sun,</p>
<p>He sat to see his people pass,</p>
<p>And judge them every one</p>
<p>From its threshold of smooth stone</p>
<p>They haled him many a valley-thief</p>
<p>Caught in the sheep-pens, robber chief</p>
<p>Swarthy and shameless, beggar, cheat,</p>
<p>Spy-prowler, or rough pirate found</p>
<p>On the sea-sand left aground;</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>These, all and every one,</p>
<p>The King judged, sitting in the sun.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>LUIGI. That King should still judge sitting in the sun!</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>His councillors, on left and right,</p>
<p>Looked anxious up,&mdash;but no surprise</p>
<p>Disturbed the King's old smiling eyes</p>
<p>Where the very blue had turned to white.</p>
<a name='Page274' id="Page274"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>274</p>
<p>'Tis said, a Python scared one day</p>
<p>The breathless city, till he came,</p>
<p>With forty tongue and eyes on flame,</p>
<p>Where the old King sat to judge alway;</p>
<p>But when he saw the sweepy hair</p>
<p>Girt with a crown of berries rare</p>
<p>Which the god will hardly give to wear</p>
<p>To the maiden who singeth, dancing bare</p>
<p>In the altar-smoke by the pine-torch lights,</p>
<p>At his wondrous forest rites,&mdash;</p>
<p>Seeing this, he did not dare</p>
<p>Approach the threshold in the sun,</p>
<p>Assault the old king smiling there.</p>
<p>Such grace had kings when the world begun!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then there are two other romantic pieces, not ringing with this
early note, but having in them a wafting scent of the
Proven&ccedil;al spirit. One is the song sung by Pippa when she
passes the room where Jules and Phene are talking&mdash;the song of
Kate, the Queen. The other is the cry Rudel, the great troubadour,
sent out of his heart to the Lady of Tripoli whom he never saw, but
loved. The subject is romantic, but that, I think, is all the
romance in it. It is not Rudel who speaks but Browning. It is not
the twelfth but the nineteenth century which has made all that
analysis and over-worked illustration.</p>
<p>There remain, on this matter, <i>Childe Roland</i> and the
<i>Flight of the Duchess</i>. I believe that <i>Childe Roland</i>
emerged, all of a sudden and to Browning's surprise, out of the
pure imagination, like the Sea-born Queen; that Browning did not
conceive it beforehand; that he had no intention in it, no reason
for writing it, and no didactic or moral aim in it. It was not even
born of his will. Nor does he seem to be acquainted with the old
story <a name='Page275' id="Page275"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>275</span>on the subject which took a ballad form in
Northern England. The impulse to write it was suddenly awakened in
him by that line out of an old song the Fool quotes in <i>King
Lear</i>. There is another tag of a song in <i>Lear</i> which stirs
a host of images in the imagination; and out of which some poet
might create a romantic lyric:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But it does not produce so concrete a set of images as <i>Childe
Roland to the Dark Tower came</i>. Browning has made that his own,
and what he has done is almost romantic. Almost romantic, I say,
because the peculiarities of Browning's personal genius appear too
strongly in <i>Childe Roland</i> for pure romantic story, in which
the idiosyncrasy of the poet, the personal element of his fancy,
are never dominant. The scenery, the images, the conduct of the
tales of romance, are, on account of their long passage through the
popular mind, impersonal.</p>
<p>Moreover, Browning's poem is too much in the vague. The romantic
tales are clear in outline; this is not. But the elements in the
original story entered, as it were of their own accord, into
Browning. There are several curious, unconscious reversions to
folk-lore which have crept into his work like living things which,
seeing Browning engaged on a story of theirs, entered into it as
into a house of their own, and without his knowledge. The wretched
cripple who points the way; the blind and wicked horse; the
accursed stream; the giant mountain range, all the peaks alive, as
if in a nature myth; the crowd of Roland's pre<a name='Page276' id=
"Page276"></a><span class='pagenum'>276</span>decessors turned to
stone by their failure; the sudden revealing of the tower where no
tower had been, might all be matched out of folk-stories. I think I
have heard that Browning wrote the poem at a breath one morning;
and it reads as if, from verse to verse, he did not know what was
coming to his pen. This is very unlike his usual way; but it is
very much the way in which tales of this kind are unconsciously
up-built.</p>
<p>Men have tried to find in the poem an allegory of human life;
but Browning had no allegorising intention. However, as every story
which was ever written has at its root the main elements of human
nature, it is always possible to make an allegory out of any one of
them. If we like to amuse ourselves in that fashion, we may do so;
but we are too bold and bad if we impute allegory to Browning.
<i>Childe Roland</i> is nothing more than a gallop over the
moorlands of imagination; and the skies of the soul, when it was
made, were dark and threatening storm. But one thing is plain in
it: it is an outcome of that passion for the mystical world, for
adventure, for the unknown, which lies at the root of the romantic
tree.</p>
<p>The <i>Flight of the Duchess</i> is full of the passion of
escape from the conventional; and no where is Browning more
original or more the poet. Its manner is exactly right, exactly
fitted to the character and condition of the narrator, who is the
Duke's huntsman. Its metrical movement is excellent, and the
changes of that movement are in harmony with the things and
feelings described. It is astonishingly swift, alive, and leaping;
and it delays, as a stream, with great charm, when <a name=
'Page277' id="Page277"></a><span class='pagenum'>277</span>the
emotion of the subject is quiet, recollective, or deep. The
descriptions of Nature in the poem are some of the most vivid and
true in Browning's work. The sketches of animal life&mdash;so
natural on the lips of the teller of the story&mdash;are done from
the keen observation of a huntsman, and with his love for the
animals he has fed, followed and slain. And, through it all, there
breathes the romantic passion&mdash;to be out of the world of
custom and commonplace, set free to wander for ever to an unknown
goal; to drink the air of adventure and change; not to know to-day
what will take place to-morrow, only to know that it will be
different; to ride on the top of the wave of life as it runs before
the wind; to live with those who live, and are of the same mind; to
be loved and to find love the best good in the world; to be the
centre of hopes and joys among those who may blame and give pain,
but who are never indifferent; to have many troubles, but always to
pursue their far-off good; to wring the life out of them, and, at
the last, to have a new life, joy and freedom in another and a
fairer world. But let Browning tell the end:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>So, at the last shall come old age.</p>
<p>Decrepit as befits that stage;</p>
<p>How else would'st thou retire apart</p>
<p>With the hoarded memories of thy heart,</p>
<p>And gather all to the very least</p>
<p>Of the fragments of life's earlier feast,</p>
<p>Let fall through eagerness to find</p>
<p>The crowning dainties yet behind?</p>
<p>Ponder on the entire past</p>
<p>Laid together thus at last,</p>
<p>When the twilight helps to fuse</p>
<p>The first fresh with the faded hues.</p>
<p>And the outline of the whole</p>
<p>Grandly fronts for once thy soul.</p>
<p>And then as, 'mid the dark, a gleam</p>
<a name='Page278' id="Page278"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>278</p>
<p>Of yet another morning breaks,</p>
<p>And, like the hand which ends a dream,</p>
<p>Death, with the might of his sunbeam,</p>
<p>Touches the flesh, and the soul awakes,</p>
<p>Then&mdash;&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Then the romance of life sweeps into the world beyond. But even
in that world the duchess will never settle down to a fixed life.
She will be, like some of us, a child of the wandering tribes of
eternity.</p>
<p>This romantic passion which never dies even in our modern
society, is embodied in the gipsy crone who, in rags and scarcely
clinging to life, suddenly lifts into youth and queenliness, just
as in a society, where romance seems old or dead, it springs into
fresh and lovely life. This is the heart of the poem, and it is
made to beat the more quickly by the wretched attempt of the duke
and his mother to bring back the observances of the Middle Ages
without their soul. Nor even then does Browning leave his motive.
The huntsman has heard the gipsy's song; he has seen the light on
his mistress' face as she rode away&mdash;the light which is not
from sun or star&mdash;and the love of the romantic world is born
in him. He will not leave his master; there his duty lies. "I must
see this fellow his sad life through." But then he will go over the
mountains, after his lady, leaving the graves of his wife and
children, into the unknown, to find her, or news of her, in the
land of the wanderers. And if he never find her, if, after pleasant
journeying, earth cannot give her to his eyes, he will still pursue
his quest in a world where romance and formality are not married
together.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3><i>IMAGINATIVE REPRESENTATIONS</i></h3>
<p>All poems might be called "imaginative representations." But the
class of poems in Browning's work to which I give that name stands
apart. It includes such poems as <i>Cleon, Caliban on Setebos, Fra
Lippo Lippi</i>, the <i>Epistle of Karshish</i>, and they isolate
themselves, not only in Browning's poetry, but in English poetry.
They have some resemblance in aim and method to the monologues of
Tennyson, such as the <i>Northern Farmer</i> or <i>Rizpah</i>, but
their aim is much wider than Tennyson's, and their method far more
elaborate and complex.</p>
<p>What do they represent? To answer this is to define within what
limits I give them the name of "imaginative representations." They
are not only separate studies of individual men as they breathed
and spoke; face, form, tricks of body recorded; intelligence,
character, temper of mind, spiritual aspiration made
clear&mdash;Tennyson did that; they are also studies of these
individual men&mdash;Cleon, Karshish and the rest&mdash;as general
types, representative images, of the age in which they lived; or of
the school of art to which they belonged; or of the crisis in
theology, religion, art, or the <a name='Page281' id=
"Page281"></a><span class='pagenum'>281</span>social movement which
took place while the men they paint were alive, and which these men
led, on formed, or followed. That is their main element, and it
defines them.</p>
<p>They are not dramatic. Their action and ideas are confined to
one person, and their circumstance and scenery to one time and
place. But Browning, unlike Tennyson, filled the background of the
stage on which he placed his single figure with a multitude of
objects, or animals, or natural scenery, or figures standing round
or in motion; and these give additional vitality and interest to
the representation. Again, they are short, as short as a soliloquy
or a letter or a conversation in a street. Shortness belongs to
this form of poetic work&mdash;a form to which Browning gave a
singular intensity. It follows that they must not be argumentative
beyond what is fitting. Nor ought they to glide into the support of
a thesis, or into didactic addresses, as <i>Bishop Blougram</i> and
<i>Mr. Sludge</i> do. These might be called treatises, and are
apart from the kind of poem of which I speak. They begin, indeed,
within its limits, but they soon transgress those limits; and are
more properly classed with poems which, also representative, have
not the brevity, the scenery, the lucidity, the objective
representation, the concentration of the age into one man's mind,
which mark out these poems from the rest, and isolate them into a
class of their own.</p>
<p>The voice we hear in them is rarely the voice of Browning; nor
is the mind of their personages his mind, save so far as he is
their creator. There are a few exceptions to this, but, on the
whole, Brown<a name='Page282' id="Page282"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>282</span>ing has, in writing these poems, stripped
himself of his own personality. He had, by creative power, made
these men; cast them off from himself, and put them into their own
age. They talk their minds out in character with their age.
Browning seems to watch them, and to wonder how they got out of his
hands and became men. That is the impression they make, and it
predicates a singular power of imagination. Like the Prometheus of
Goethe, the poet sits apart, moulding men and then endowing them
with life. But he cannot tell, any more than Prometheus, what they
will say and do after he has made them. He does tell, of course,
but that is not our impression. Our impression is that they live
and talk of their own accord, so vitally at home they are in the
country, the scenery, and the thinking of the place and time in
which he has imagined them.</p>
<p>Great knowledge seems required for this, and Browning had indeed
an extensive knowledge not so much of the historical facts, as of
the tendencies of thought which worked in the times wherein he
placed his men. But the chief knowledge he had, through his curious
reading, was of a multitude of small intimate details of the
customs, clothing, architecture, dress, popular talk and scenery of
the towns and country of Italy from the thirteenth century up to
modern times. To every one of these details&mdash;such as are found
in <i>Sordello</i>, in <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>, in the <i>Bishop
orders his Tomb at St. Praxed's Church</i>&mdash;his vivid and
grasping imagination gave an uncommon reality.</p>
<p>But even without great knowledge such poems may be written, if
the poet have imagination, and <a name='Page283' id=
"Page283"></a><span class='pagenum'>283</span>the power to execute
in metrical words what has been imagined. <i>Theology in the
Island</i> and the prologue to a <i>Death in the Desert</i> are
examples of this. Browning knew nothing of that island in the
undiscovered seas where Prosper dwelt, but he made all the scenery
of it and all its animal life, and he re-created Caliban. He had
never seen the cave in the desert where he placed John to die, nor
the sweep of rocky hills and sand around it, nor the Bactrian
waiting with the camels. Other poets, of course, have seen unknown
lands and alien folks, but he has seen them more vividly, more
briefly, more forcibly. His imagination was objective enough.</p>
<p>But it was as subjective as it was objective. He saw the soul of
Fra Lippo Lippi and the soul of his time as vividly as he saw the
streets of Florence at night, the watch, the laughing girls, and
the palace of the Medici round the corner. It was a remarkable
combination, and it is by this combination of the subjective and
objective imagination that he draws into some dim approach to
Shakespeare; and nowhere closer than in these poems.</p>
<p>Again, not only the main character of each of these poems, but
all the figures introduced (sometimes only in a single line) to
fill up the background, are sketched with as true and vigorous a
pencil as the main figure; are never out of place or harmony with
the whole, and are justly subordinated. The young men who stand
round the Bishop's bed when he orders his tomb, the watchmen in
<i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>, the group of St. John's disciples, are as
alive, and as much in tune with the whole, as the servants and
tenants of Justice <a name='Page284' id="Page284"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>284</span>Shallow. Again, it is not only the lesser
figures, but the scenery of these poems which is worth our study.
That also is closely fitted to the main subject. The imagination
paints it for that, and nothing else. It would not fit any other
subject. For imagination, working at white heat, cannot do what is
out of harmony; no more than a great musician can introduce a false
chord. All goes together in these poems&mdash;scenery, characters,
time, place and action.</p>
<p>Then, also, the extent of their range is remarkable. Their
subjects begin with savage man making his god out of himself. They
pass through Greek mythology to early Christian times; from Artemis
and Pan to St. John dying in the desert. Then, still in the same
period, while Paul was yet alive, he paints another aspect of the
time in Cleon the rich artist, the friend of kings, who had reached
the top of life, included all the arts in himself, yet dimly craved
for more than earth could give. From these times the poems pass on
to the early and late Renaissance, and from that to the struggle
for freedom in Italy, and from that to modern life in Europe. This
great range illustrates the penetration and the versatility of his
genius. He could place us with ease and truth at Corinth, Athens or
Rome, in Paris, Vienna or London; and wherever we go with him we
are at home.</p>
<p>One word more must be said about the way a great number of these
poems arose. They leaped up in his imagination full-clad and
finished at a single touch from the outside. <i>Caliban upon
Setebos</i> took its rise from a text in the Bible which darted
into his mind as he read the <i>Tempest</i>. <i>Cleon</i> arose
<a name='Page285' id="Page285"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>285</span>as he read that verse in St. Paul's speech at
Athens, "As certain also of your own poets have said." I fancy that
<i>An Epistle of Karshish</i> was born one day when he read those
two stanzas in <i>In Memoriam</i> about Lazarus, and imagined how
the subject would come to him. <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i> slipped into
his mind one day at the Belle Arti at Florence as he stood before
the picture described in the poem, and walked afterwards at night
through the streets of Florence. These fine things are born in a
moment, and come into our world from poet, painter, and musician,
full-grown; built, like Aladdin's palace, with all their jewels, in
a single night. They are inexplicable by any scientific
explanation, as inexplicable as genius itself. When have the
hereditarians explained Shakespeare, Mozart, Turner? When has the
science of the world explained the birth of a lyric of Burns, a
song of Beethoven's, or a drawing of Raffaelle? Let these gentlemen
veil their eyes, and confess their inability to explain the facts.
For it is fact they touch. "Full fathom five thy father
lies"&mdash;that song of Shakespeare exists. The overture to Don
Giovanni is a reality. We can see the Bacchus and Ariadne at the
National Gallery and the Theseus at the Museum. These are facts;
but they are a million million miles beyond the grasp of any
science. Nay, the very smallest things of their kind, the slightest
water-colour sketch of Turner, a half-finished clay sketch of
Donatello, the little song done in the corner of a provincial paper
by a working clerk in a true poetic hour, are not to be fathomed by
the most far-descending plummet of the scientific understanding.
These things are in that super<a name='Page286' id=
"Page286"></a><span class='pagenum'>286</span>physical world into
which, however closely he saw and dealt with his characters in the
world of the senses, the conscience, or the understanding, Browning
led them all at last.</p>
<p>The first of these poems is <i>Natural Theology on the Island;
or, Caliban upon Setebos</i>. Caliban, with the instincts and
intelligence of an early savage, has, in an hour of holiday, set
himself to conceive what Setebos, his mother's god, is like in
character. He talks out the question with himself, and because he
is in a vague fear lest Setebos, hearing him soliloquise about him,
should feel insulted and swing a thunder-bolt at him, he not only
hides himself in the earth, but speaks in the third person, as if
it was not he that spoke; hoping in that fashion to trick his
God.</p>
<p>Browning, conceiving in himself the mind and temper of an
honest, earthly, imaginative savage&mdash;who is developed far
enough to build nature-myths in their coarse early
forms&mdash;architectures the character of Setebos out of the
habits, caprices, fancies, likes and dislikes, and thoughts of
Caliban; and an excellent piece of penetrative imagination it is.
Browning has done nothing better, though he has done as well.</p>
<p>But Browning's Caliban is not a single personage. No one savage,
at no one time, would have all these thoughts of his God. He is the
representative of what has been thought, during centuries, by many
thousands of men; the concentration into one mind of the
ground-thoughts of early theology. At one point, as if Browning
wished to sketch the beginning of a new theological period, Caliban
represents a more advanced thought than savage man conceives.
<a name='Page287' id="Page287"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>287</span>This is Caliban's imagination of a higher being
than Setebos who is the capricious creator and power of the
earth&mdash;of the "Quiet," who is master of Setebos and whose
temper is quite different; who also made the stars, things which
Caliban, with a touch of Browning's subtle thought, separates from
the sun and moon and earth. It is plain from this, and from the
whole argument which is admirably conducted, that Caliban is an
intellectual personage, too long neglected; and Prospero, could he
have understood his nature, would have enjoyed his conversation.
Renan agreed with Browning in this estimate of his intelligence,
and made him the foundation of a philosophical play.</p>
<p>There is some slight reason for this in Shakespeare's invention.
He lifts Caliban in intellect, even in feeling, far above Trinculo,
Stephano, the Boatswain and the rest of the common men. The
objection, however, has been made that Browning makes him too
intelligent. The answer is that Browning is not drawing Caliban
only, but embodying in an imagined personage the thoughts about God
likely to be invented by early man during thousands of
years&mdash;and this accounts for the insequences in Caliban's
thinking. They are not the thoughts of one but of several men. Yet
a certain poetic unity is given to them by the unity of place. The
continual introduction of the landscape to be seen from his refuge
knits the discursive thinking of the savage into a kind of unity.
We watch him lying in the thick water-slime of the hollow, his head
on the rim of it propped by his hands, under the cave's mouth,
hidden by the gadding gourds and vines; looking <a name='Page288'
id="Page288"></a><span class='pagenum'>288</span>out to sea and
watching the wild animals that pass him by&mdash;and out of this
place he does not stir.</p>
<p>In Shakespeare's <i>Tempest</i> Caliban is the gross, brutal
element of the earth and is opposed to Ariel, the light, swift,
fine element of the air. Caliban curses Prospero with the evils of
the earth, with the wicked dew of the fen and the red plague of the
sea-marsh. Browning's Caliban does not curse at all. When he is not
angered, or in a caprice, he is a good-natured creature, full of
animal enjoyment. He loves to lie in the cool slush, like a
lias-lizard, shivering with earthy pleasure when his spine is
tickled by the small eft-things that course along it,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Run in and out each arm, and make him laugh.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poem is full of these good, close, vivid realisations of the
brown prolific earth.</p>
<p>Browning had his own sympathy with Caliban Nor does Shakespeare
make him altogether brutish. He has been so educated by his close
contact with nature that his imagination has been kindled. His very
cursing is imaginative:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>As wicked dew as e'er my mother brushed</p>
<p>With raven's feather from unwholesome fen</p>
<p>Drop on you both; a south-west blow on you</p>
<p>And blister you all o'er.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Stephano and Trinculo, vulgar products of civilisation, could
never have said that. Moreover, Shakespeare's Caliban, like
Browning's, has the poetry of the earth-man in him. When Ariel
plays, Trinculo and Stephano think it must be the devil, and
Trinculo is afraid: but Caliban loves and enjoys the music for
itself:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page289' id="Page289"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>289</p>
<p>Be not afear'd; the isle is full of noises,</p>
<p>Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.</p>
<p>Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments</p>
<p>Will hum about mine ears, and sometimes voices</p>
<p>That, if I then had waked after long sleep.</p>
<p>Will make me sleep again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Stephano answers, like a modern millionaire:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>This will prove a brave kingdom for me, where I shall have</p>
<p>my music for nothing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Browning's Caliban is also something of a poet, and loves the
Nature of whom he is a child. We are not surprised when he</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>looks out o'er yon sea which sunbeams cross</p>
<p>And recross till they weave a spider web</p>
<p>(Meshes of fire some great fish breaks at times)</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>though the phrase is full of a poet's imagination, for so the
living earth would see and feel the sea. It belongs also to
Caliban's nearness to the earth that he should have the keenest of
eyes for animals, and that poetic pleasure in watching their life
which, having seen them vividly, could describe them vividly. I
quote one example from the poem; there are many others:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'Thinketh, He made thereat the sun, this isle,</p>
<p>Trees and the fowls here, beast and creeping thing.</p>
<p>Yon otter, sleek-wet, black, lithe as a leech;</p>
<p>Yon auk, one fire-eye in a ball of foam,</p>
<p>That floats and feeds; a certain badger brown</p>
<p>He hath watched hunt with that slant white-wedge eye</p>
<p>By moonlight; and the pie with the long tongue</p>
<p>That pricks deep into oakwarts for a worm,</p>
<p>And says a plain word when she finds her prize,</p>
<p>But will not eat the ants; the ants themselves</p>
<p>That build a wall of seeds and settled stalks</p>
<p>About their hole&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>There are two more remarks to make about this <a name='Page290'
id="Page290"></a><span class='pagenum'>290</span>poem. First, that
Browning makes Caliban create a dramatic world in which Miranda,
Ariel, and he himself play their parts, and in which he assumes the
part of Prosper. That is, Caliban invents a new world out of the
persons he knows, but different from them, and a second self
outside himself. No lower animal has ever conceived of such a
creation. Secondly, Browning makes Caliban, in order to exercise
his wit and his sense of what is beautiful, fall to making
something&mdash;a bird, an insect, or a building which he
ornaments, which satisfies him for a time, and which he then
destroys to make a better. This is art in its beginning; and the
highest animal we know of is incapable of it. We know that the men
of the caves were capable of it. When they made a drawing, a piece
of carving, they were unsatisfied until they had made a better.
When they made a story out of what they knew and saw, they went on
to make more. Creation, invention, art&mdash;this, independent
entirely of the religious desire, makes the infinite gulf which
divides man from the highest animals.</p>
<p>I do not mean, in this book, to speak of the theology of
Caliban, though the part of the poem which concerns the origin of
sacrifice is well worth our attention. But the poem may be
recommended to those theological persons who say there is no God;
and to that large class of professional theologians, whose idea of
a capricious, jealous, suddenly-angered God, without any conscience
except his sense of power to do as he pleases, is quite in harmony
with Caliban's idea of Setebos.</p>
<p>The next of these "imaginative representations" is the poem
called <i>Cleon</i>. Cleon is a rich and <a name='Page291' id=
"Page291"></a><span class='pagenum'>291</span>famous artist of the
Grecian isles, alive while St. Paul was still making his missionary
journeys, just at the time when the Gr&aelig;co-Roman culture had
attained a height of refinement, but had lost originating power;
when it thought it had mastered all the means for a perfect life,
but was, in reality, trembling in a deep dissatisfaction on the
edge of its first descent into exhaustion. Then, as everything good
had been done in the art of the past, cultivated men began to ask
"Was there anything worth doing?" "Was life itself worth living?";
questions never asked by those who are living. Or "What is life in
its perfection, and when shall we have it?"; a question also not
asked by those who live in the morning of a new &aelig;ra, when the
world&mdash;as in Elizabeth's days, as in 1789, as perhaps it may
be in a few years&mdash;is born afresh; but which is asked
continually in the years when a great movement of life has passed
its culminating point and has begun to decline. Again and again the
world has heard these questions; in Cleon's time, and when the
Renaissance had spent its force, and at the end of the reign of
Louis XIV., and before Elizabeth's reign had closed, and about 1820
in England, and of late years also in our society. This is the
temper and the time that Browning embodies in Cleon, who is the
incarnation of a culture which is already feeling that life is
going out of it.</p>
<p>Protus, the king, has written to him, and the poem is Cleon's
answer to the king. Browning takes care, as usual, to have his
background of scenery quite clear and fair. It is a courtyard to
Cleon's house in one of the sprinkled isles&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page292' id="Page292"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>292</p>
<p>Lily on lily, that o'erlace the sea,</p>
<p>And laugh their pride when the light wave lisps "Greece."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I quote it; it marks the man and the age of luxurious
culture.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>They give thy letter to me, even now;</p>
<p>I read and seem as if I heard thee speak.</p>
<p>The master of thy galley still unlades</p>
<p>Gift after gift; they block my court at last</p>
<p>And pile themselves along its portico</p>
<p>Royal with sunset, like a thought of thee;</p>
<p>And one white she-slave from the group dispersed</p>
<p>Of black and white slaves (like the chequer work</p>
<p>Pavement, at once my nation's work and gift,</p>
<p>Now covered with this settle-down of doves),</p>
<p>One lyric woman, in her crocus vest</p>
<p>Woven of sea-wools, with her two white hands</p>
<p>Commends to me the strainer and the cup</p>
<p>Thy lip hath bettered ere it blesses mine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But he is more than luxurious. He desires the highest life, and
he praises the king because he has acknowledged by his gifts the
joy that Art gives to life; and most of all he praises him, because
he too aspires, building a mighty tower, not that men may look at
it, but that he may gaze from its height on the sun, and think what
higher he may attain. The tower is the symbol of the cry of the
king's soul.</p>
<p>Then he answers the king's letter. "It is true, O king, I am
poet, sculptor, painter, architect, philosopher, musician; all arts
are mine. Have I done as well as the great men of old? No, but I
have combined their excellences into one man, into myself.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"I have not chanted verse like Homer, no&mdash;</p>
<p>Nor swept string like Terpander&mdash;no&mdash;nor carved</p>
<p>And painted men like Phidias and his friend:</p>
<p>I am not great as they are, point by point.</p>
<a name='Page293' id="Page293"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>293</p>
<p>But I have entered into sympathy</p>
<p>With these four, running these into one soul,</p>
<p>Who, separate, ignored each other's art.</p>
<p>Say, is it nothing that I know them all?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"This, since the best in each art has already been done, was the
only progress possible, and I have made it. It is not unworthy,
king!</p>
<p>"Well, now thou askest, if having done this, 'I have not
attained the very crown of life; if I cannot now comfortably and
fearlessly meet death?' 'I, Cleon, leave,' thou sayest, 'my life
behind me in my poems, my pictures; I am immortal in my work. What
more can life desire?'"</p>
<p>It is the question so many are asking now, and it is the answer
now given. What better immortality than in one's work left behind
to move in men? What more than this can life desire? But Cleon does
not agree with that. "If thou, O king, with the light now in thee,
hadst looked at creation before man appeared, thou wouldst have
said, 'All is perfect so far.' But questioned if anything more
perfect in joy might be, thou wouldst have said, 'Yes; a being may
be made, unlike these who do not know the joy they have, who shall
be conscious of himself, and know that he is happy. Then his life
will be satisfied with daily joy.'" O king, thou wouldst have
answered foolishly. The higher the soul climbs in joy the more it
sees of joy, and when it sees the most, it perishes. Vast
capabilities of joy open round it; it craves for all it presages;
desire for more deepening with every attainment. And then the body
intervenes. Age, sickness, decay, forbid attainment. Life is
inadequate to joy. What have the gods done? It cannot be <a name=
'Page294' id="Page294"></a><span class='pagenum'>294</span>their
malice, no, nor carelessness; but&mdash;to let us see oceans of
joy, and only give us power to hold a cupful&mdash;is that to live?
It is misery, and the more of joy my artist nature makes me capable
of feeling, the deeper my misery.</p>
<p>"But then, O king, thou sayest 'that I leave behind me works
that will live; works, too, which paint the joy of life.' Yes, but
to show what the joy of life is, is not to have it. If I carve the
young Phoebus, am I therefore young? I can write odes of the
delight of love, but grown too grey to be beloved, can I have its
delight? That fair slave of yours, and the rower with the muscles
all a ripple on his back who lowers the sail in the bay, can write
no love odes nor can they paint the joy of love; but they can have
it&mdash;not I."</p>
<p>The knowledge, he thinks, of what joy is, of all that life can
give, which increases in the artist as his feebleness increases,
makes his fate the deadlier. What is it to him that his works live?
He does not live. The hand of death grapples the throat of life at
the moment when he sees most clearly its infinite possibilities.
Decay paralyses his hand when he knows best how to use his tools.
It is accomplished wretchedness.</p>
<p>I quote his outburst. It is in the soul of thousands who have no
hope of a life to come.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"But," sayest thou&mdash;(and I marvel, I repeat,</p>
<p>To find thee trip on such a mere word) "what</p>
<p>Thou writest, paintest, stays; that does not die:</p>
<p>Sappho survives, because we sing her songs,</p>
<p>And &AElig;schylus, because we read his plays!"</p>
<p>Why, if they live still, let them come and take</p>
<p>Thy slave in my despite, drink from thy cup,</p>
<p>Speak in my place! "Thou diest while I survive?"&mdash;</p>
<a name='Page295' id="Page295"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>295</p>
<p>Say rather that my fate is deadlier still,</p>
<p>In this, that every day my sense of joy</p>
<p>Grows more acute, my soul (intensified</p>
<p>By power and insight) more enlarged, more keen;</p>
<p>While every day my hairs fall more and more,</p>
<p>My hand shakes, and the heavy years increase&mdash;</p>
<p>The horror quickening still from year to year,</p>
<p>The consummation coming past escape</p>
<p>When I shall know most, and yet least enjoy&mdash;</p>
<p>When all my works wherein I prove my worth,</p>
<p>Being present still to mock me in men's mouths,</p>
<p>Alive still, in the praise of such as thou,</p>
<p>I, I the feeling, thinking, acting man,</p>
<p>The man who loved his life so overmuch,</p>
<p>Sleep in my urn. It is so horrible</p>
<p>I dare at times imagine to my need</p>
<p>Some future state revealed to us by Zeus,</p>
<p>Unlimited in capability</p>
<p>For joy, as this is in desire of joy,</p>
<p>&mdash;To seek which the joy-hunger forces us:</p>
<p>That, stung by straitness of our life, made strait</p>
<p>On purpose to make prized the life at large&mdash;</p>
<p>Freed by the throbbing impulse we call death,</p>
<p>We burst there as the worm into the fly.</p>
<p>Who, while a worm still, wants his wings. But no!</p>
<p>Zeus has not yet revealed it; and alas,</p>
<p>He must have done so, were it possible!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is one only of Browning's statements of what he held to be
the fierce necessity for another life. Without it, nothing is left
for humanity, having arrived at full culture, knowledge, at
educated love of beauty, at finished morality and
unselfishness&mdash;nothing in the end but Cleon's
cry&mdash;sorrowful, somewhat stern, yet gentle&mdash;to
Protus,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Live long and happy, and in that thought die,</p>
<p>Glad for what was. Farewell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But for those who are not Cleon and Protus, not kings in comfort
or poets in luxury, who have had no gladness, what end&mdash;what
is to be said of them? <a name='Page296' id=
"Page296"></a><span class='pagenum'>296</span>I will not stay to
speak of <i>A Death in the Desert</i>, which is another of these
poems, because the most part of it is concerned with questions of
modern theology. St. John awakes into clear consciousness just
before his death in the cave where he lies tended by a few
disciples. He foresees some of the doubts of this century and meets
them as he can. The bulk of this poem, very interesting in its way,
is Browning's exposition of his own belief, not an imaginative
representation of what St. John actually would have said. It does
not therefore come into my subject. What does come into it is the
extraordinary naturalness and vitality of the description given by
John's disciple of the place where they were, and the fate of his
companions. This is invented in Browning's most excellent way. It
could not be better done.</p>
<p>The next poem is the <i>Epistle of Karshish, the Arab
Physician</i>, to his master, concerning his strange medical
experience. The time is just before the last siege of Jerusalem,
and Karshish, journeying through Jericho, and up the pass, stays
for a few days at Bethany and meets Lazarus. His case amazes him,
and though he thinks his interest in it unworthy of a man of
science in comparison with the new herbs and new diseases he has
discovered, yet he is carried away by it and gives a full account
of it to his master.</p>
<p>I do not think that Browning ever wrote a poem the writing of
which he more enjoyed. The creation of Karshish suited his humour
and his quaint play with recondite knowledge. He describes the
physician till we see him alive and thinking, in body and soul. The
creation of Lazarus is even a <a name='Page297' id=
"Page297"></a><span class='pagenum'>297</span>higher example of the
imaginative power of Browning; and that it is shaped for us through
the mind of Karshish, and in tune with it, makes the imaginative
effort the more remarkable. Then the problem&mdash;how to express
the condition of a man's body and soul, who, having for three days
according to the story as Browning conceives it lived consciously
in the eternal and perfect world, has come back to dwell in this
world&mdash;was so difficult and so involved in metaphysical
strangenesses, that it delighted him.</p>
<p>Of course, he carefully prepares his scenery to give a true
semblance to the whole. Karshish comes up the flinty pass from
Jericho; he is attacked by thieves twice and beaten, and the wild
beasts endanger his path;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>A black lynx snarled and pricked a tufted ear,</p>
<p>Lust of my blood inflamed his yellow balls;</p>
<p>I cried and threw my staff and he was gone,</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and then, at the end of the pass, he met Lazarus. See how
vividly the scenery is realised&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I crossed a ridge of short, sharp, broken hills</p>
<p>Like an old lion's cheek-teeth. Out there came</p>
<p>A moon made like a face with certain spots,</p>
<p>Multiform, manifold and menacing:</p>
<p>Then a wind rose behind me. So we met</p>
<p>In this old sleepy town at unaware</p>
<p>The man and I.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And the weird evening, Karshish thinks, had something to do with
the strange impression the man has made on him. Then we are placed
in the dreamy village of Bethany. We hear of its elders, its
diseases, its flowers, its herbs and gums, of the insects which may
help medicine&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page298' id="Page298"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>298</p>
<p class='i12'>There is a spider here</p>
<p>Weaves no web, watches on the ledge of tombs,</p>
<p>Sprinkled with mottles on an ash-grey back;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>and then, how the countryside is all on fire with news of
Vespasian marching into Jud&aelig;a. So we have the place, the
village, the hills, the animals, and the time, all clear, and half
of the character of Karshish. The inner character of the man
emerges as clearly when he comes to deal with Lazarus. This is not
a case of the body, he thinks, but of the soul. "The Syrian," he
tells his master, "has had catalepsy, and a learned leech of his
nation, slain soon afterwards, healed him and brought him back to
life after three days. He says he was dead, and made alive again,
but that is his madness; though the man seems sane enough. At any
rate, his disease has disappeared, he is as well as you and I. But
the mind and soul of the man, that is the strange matter, and in
that he is entirely unlike other men. Whatever he has gone through
has rebathed him as in clear water of another life, and penetrated
his whole being. He views the world like a child, he scarcely
listens to what goes on about him, yet he is no fool. If one could
fancy a man endowed with perfect knowledge beyond the fleshly
faculty, and while he has this heaven in him forced to live on
earth, such a man is he. His heart and brain move there, his feet
stay here. He has lost all sense of our values of things. Vespasian
besieging Jerusalem and a mule passing with gourds awaken the same
interest. But speak of some little fact, little as we think, and he
stands astonished with its prodigious import. If his child sicken
to death it does not seem to matter <a name='Page299' id=
"Page299"></a><span class='pagenum'>299</span>to him, but a
gesture, a glance from the child, starts him into an agony of fear
and anger, as if the child were undoing the universe. He lives like
one between two regions, one of distracting glory, of which he is
conscious but must not enter yet; and the other into which he has
been exiled back again&mdash;and between this region where his soul
moves and the earth where his body is, there is so little harmony
of thought or feeling that he cannot undertake any human activity,
nor unite the demands of the two worlds. He knows that what ought
to be cannot be in the world he has returned to, so that his life
is perplexed; but in this incessant perplexity he falls back on
prone submission to the heavenly will. The time will come when
death will restore his being to equilibrium; but now he is out of
harmony, for the soul knows more than the body and the body clouds
the soul."</p>
<p>"I probed this seeming indifference. 'Beast, to be so still and
careless when Rome is at the gates of thy town.' He merely looked
with his large eyes at me. Yet the man is not apathetic, but loves
old and young, the very brutes and birds and flowers of the field.
His only impatience is with wrongdoing, but he curbs that
impatience."</p>
<p>At last Karshish tells, with many apologies for his foolishness,
the strangest thing of all. Lazarus thinks that his curer was God
himself who came and dwelt in flesh among those he had made, and
went in and out among them healing and teaching, and then died. "It
is strange, but why write of trivial matters when things of price
call every moment for remark? Forget it, my master, pardon me and
farewell."</p>
<p><a name='Page300' id="Page300"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>300</span>Then comes the postscript, that impression
which, in spite of all his knowledge, is left in Karshish's
mind&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>The very God! think, Abib; dost thou think?</p>
<p>So, the All-Great were the All-Loving too&mdash;</p>
<p>So, through the thunder comes a human voice</p>

<p>Face, my hands fashioned, see it in myself!</p>
<p>Thou hast no power, nor may'st conceive of mine,</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3><i>IMAGINATIVE REPRESENTATIONS<br />
RENAISSANCE</i></h3>
<p>The Imaginative Representations to be discussed in this chapter
are those which belong to the time of the Renaissance. We take a
great leap when we pass from Karshish and Cleon to Fra Lippo Lippi,
from early Christian times to the early manhood of the Renaissance.
But these leaps are easy to a poet, and Browning is even more at
his ease and in his strength in the fifteenth century than in the
first.</p>
<p>We have seen with what force in <i>Sordello</i> he realised the
life and tumult of the thirteenth century. The fourteenth century
does not seem to have attracted him much, though he frequently
refers to its work in Florence; but when the Renaissance in the
fifteenth century took its turn with decision towards a more open
freedom of life and thought, abandoning one after another the
conventions of the past; when the moral limits, which the Church
still faintly insisted on, were more and more withdrawn and finally
blotted out; when, as the century passed into the next, the Church
led the revolt against decency, order, and morality; when
scepticism took the place of faith, even of duty, and criticism the
place <a name='Page302' id="Page302"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>302</span>of authority, then Browning became interested,
not of course in the want of faith and in immorality, but in the
swift variety and intensity of the movement of intellectual and
social life, and in the interlacing changes of the movement. This
was an enchanting world for him, and as he was naturally most
interested in the arts, he represented the way in which the main
elements of the Renaissance appeared to him in poems which were
concerned with music, poetry, painting and the rest of the arts,
but chiefly with painting. Of course, when the Renaissance began to
die down into senile pride and decay, Browning, who never ceased to
choose and claim companionship with vigorous life, who abhorred
decay either in Nature or nations, in societies or in cliques of
culture, who would have preferred a blood-red pirate to the
daintiest of decadents&mdash;did not care for it, and in only one
poem, touched with contemptuous pity and humour, represented its
disease and its disintegrating elements, with so much power,
however, with such grasping mastery, that it is like a painting by
Velasquez. Ruskin said justly that the <i>Bishop orders his Tomb at
St. Praxed's Church</i> concentrated into a few lines all the evil
elements of the Renaissance. But this want of care for the decaying
Renaissance was contrasted by the extreme pleasure with which he
treated its early manhood in <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>.</p>
<p>The Renaissance had a life and seasons, like those of a human
being. It went through its childhood and youth like a boy of genius
under the care of parents from whose opinions and mode of life he
is sure to sever himself in the end; but <a name='Page303' id=
"Page303"></a><span class='pagenum'>303</span>who, having made a
deep impression on his nature, retain power over, and give
direction to, his first efforts at creation. The first art of the
Renaissance, awakened by the discovery of the classic remnants,
retained a great deal of the faith and superstition, the
philosophy, theology, and childlike <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of
the middle ages. Its painting and sculpture, but chiefly the first
of these, gave themselves chiefly to the representation of the soul
upon the face, and of the untutored and unconscious movements of
the body under the influence of religious passion; that is, such
movements as expressed devotion, fervent love of Christ, horror of
sin, were chosen, and harmonised with the expression of the face.
Painting dedicated its work to the representation of the heavenly
life, either on earth in the story of the gospels and in the lives
of the saints, or in its glory in the circles of heaven. Then, too,
it represented the thought, philosophy, and knowledge of its own
time and of the past in symbolic series of quiet figures, in
symbolic pictures of the struggle of good with evil, of the Church
with the world, of the virtues with their opposites. Naturally,
then, the expression on the face of secular passions, the movement
of figures in war and trade and social life and the whole vast
field of human life in the ordinary world, were neglected as
unworthy of representation; and the free, full life of the body,
its beauty, power and charm, the objects which pleased its senses,
the frank representation of its movement under the influence of the
natural as contrasted with the spiritual passions, were looked upon
with religious dismay. Such, but less in sculpture than in
painting, was the art <a name='Page304' id=
"Page304"></a><span class='pagenum'>304</span>of the Renaissance in
its childhood and youth, and Browning has scarcely touched that
time. He had no sympathy with a neglect of the body, a contempt of
the senses or of the beauty they perceived. He claimed the physical
as well as the intellectual and spiritual life of man as by origin
and of right divine. When, then, in harmony with a great change in
social and literary life, the art of the Renaissance began to turn,
in its early manhood, from the representation of the soul to the
representation of the body in natural movement and beauty; from the
representation of saints, angels and virtues to the representation
of actual men and women in the streets and rooms of Florence; from
symbolism to reality&mdash;Browning thought, "This suits me; this
is what I love; I will put this mighty change into a poem." And he
wrote <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>.</p>
<p>As long as this vivid representation of actual human life
lasted, the art of the Renaissance was active, original, and
interesting; and as it moved on, developing into higher and finer
forms, and producing continually new varieties in its development,
it reached its strong and eager manhood. In its art then, as well
as in other matters, the Renaissance completed its new and clear
theory of life; it remade the grounds of life, of its action and
passion; and it reconstituted its aims. Browning loved this summer
time of the Renaissance, which began with the midst of the
fifteenth century. But he loved its beginnings even more than its
fulness. That was characteristic. I have said that even when he was
eighty years old, his keenest sympathies were with spring rather
than <a name='Page305' id="Page305"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>305</span>summer, with those times of vital change when
fresh excitements disturbed the world, when its eyes were smiling
with hope, and its feet eager with the joy of pursuit. He rejoiced
to analyse and embody a period which was shaking off the past,
living intensely in the present, and prophesying the future. It
charms us, as we read him, to see his intellect and his soul like
two hunting dogs, and with all their eagerness, questing, roving,
quartering, with the greatest joy and in incessant movement, over a
time like this, where so many diverse, clashing, and productive
elements mingled themselves into an enchanting confusion and glory
of life. Out of that pleasure of hunting in a morning-tide of
humanity, was born <i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i>; and there is scarcely an
element of the time, except the political elements, which it does
not represent; not dwelt on, but touched for the moment and left;
unconsciously produced as two men of the time would produce them in
conversation. The poem seems as easy as a chat in Pall Mall last
night between some intelligent men, which, read two hundred years
hence, would inform the reader of the trend of thought and feeling
in this present day. But in reality to do this kind of thing well
is to do a very difficult thing. It needs a full knowledge, a full
imagination and a masterly execution. Yet when we read the poem, it
seems as natural as the breaking out of blossoms. This is that
divine thing, the ease of genius.</p>
<p>The scenery of the poem is as usual clear. We are in
fifteenth-century Florence at night. There is no set description,
but the slight touches are enough to make us see the silent lonely
streets, the churches, the high walls of the monastic gardens,
<a name='Page306' id="Page306"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>306</span>the fortress-palaces. The sound of the
fountains is in our ears; the little crowds of revelling men and
girls appear and disappear like ghosts; the surly watch with their
weapons and torches bustle round the corner. Nor does Browning
neglect to paint by slight enlivening touches, introduced into
Lippo Lippi's account of himself as a starving boy, the aspect by
day and the character of the Florence of the fifteenth century.
This painting of his, slight as it is, is more alive than all the
elaborate descriptions in <i>Romola</i>.</p>
<p>As to the poem itself, Browning plunges at once into his matter;
no long approaches, no elaborate porches belong to his work. The
man and his character are before us in a moment&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!</p>
<p>You need not clap your torches to my face.</p>
<p>Zooks, what's to blame? You think you see a monk!</p>
<p>What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,</p>
<p>And here you catch me at an alley's end</p>
<p>Where sportive ladies leave their doors ajar?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For three weeks he has painted saints, and saints, and saints
again, for Cosimo in the Medici Palace; but now the time of
blossoms has come. Florence is now awake at nights; the secret of
the spring moves in his blood; the man leaps up, the monk
retires.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.</p>
<p>There came a hurry of feet and little feet,</p>
<p>A sweep of lute-strings, laughs and whifts of song,&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'><i>Flower o' the broom.</i></p>
<p class='i2'><i>Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!</i></p>
<p class='i2'><i>Flower of the quince</i>,</p>
<p class='i2'><i>I let Lisa go, and what good in life
since?</i></p>
<p class='i2'><i>Flower of the thyme</i>&mdash;and so on. Round
they went.</p>
<a name='Page307' id="Page307"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>307</p>
<p>Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter,</p>
<p>Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,&mdash;three slim
shapes,</p>
<p>And a face that looked up ... zooks, sir, flesh and blood,</p>
<p>That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went,</p>
<p>Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,</p>
<p>All the bed furniture&mdash;a dozen knots,</p>
<p>There was a ladder! Down I let myself,</p>
<p>Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,</p>
<p>And after them. I came up with the fun</p>
<p>Hard by St. Laurence, hail fellow, well met,&mdash;</p>
<p class='i2'><i>Flower o' the rose,</i></p>
<p class='i2'><i>If I've been merry, what matter who knows?</i></p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is a picture, not only of the man, but of the time and its
temper, when religion and morality, as well as that simplicity of
life which Dante describes, had lost their ancient power over
society in Florence; when the claim to give to human nature all it
desired had stolen into the Church itself. Even in the monasteries,
the long seclusion from natural human life had produced a reaction,
which soon, indulging itself as Fra Lippo Lippi did, ran into an
extremity of licence. Nevertheless, something of the old religious
life lasted at the time of this poem. It stretched one hand back to
the piety of the past, and retained, though faith and devotion had
left them, its observances and conventions; so that, at first, when
Lippo was painting, the new only peeped out of the old, like the
saucy face of a nymph from the ilexes of a sacred grove. This is
the historical moment Browning illustrates. Lippo Lippi was forced
to paint the worn religious subjects: Jerome knocking his breast,
the choirs of angels and martyrs, the scenes of the Gospel; but out
of all he did the eager modern life began to glance! Natural,
quaint, original faces and attitudes appeared; the angels smiled
like Florentine <a name='Page308' id="Page308"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>308</span>women; the saints wore the air of Bohemians.
There is a picture by Lippo Lippi in the National Gallery of some
nine of them sitting on a bench under a hedge of roses, and it is
no paradox to say that they might fairly represent the Florentines
who tell the tales of the <i>Decameron</i>.</p>
<p>The transition as it appeared in art is drawn in this poem.
Lippo Lippi became a monk by chance; it was not his vocation. A
starving boy, he roamed the streets of Florence; and the widespread
intelligence of the city is marked by Browning's account of the way
in which the <i>boy</i> observed all the life of the streets for
eight years. Then the coming change of the aims of art is indicated
by the way in which, when he was allowed to paint, he covered the
walls of the Carmine, not with saints, virgins, and angels, but
with the daily life of the streets&mdash;the boy patting the dog,
the murderer taking refuge at the altar, the white wrath of the
avenger coming up the aisle, the girl going to market, the crowd
round the stalls in the market, the monks, white, grey, and
black&mdash;things as they were, as like as two peas to the
reality; flesh and blood now painted, not skin and bone; not the
expression on the face alone, but the whole body in speaking
movement; nothing conventional, nothing imitative of old models,
but actual life as it lay before the painter's eyes. Into this
fresh &aelig;ra of art Lippo Lippi led the way with the joy of
youth. But he was too soon. The Prior, all the representatives of
the conservative elements in the convent, were sorely troubled.
"Why, this will never do: faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the
true; life as it is; nature as she is; quite impossible." And
Browning, in <a name='Page309' id="Page309"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>309</span>Lippo's defence of himself, paints the conflict
of the past with the coming art in a passage too long to quote, too
admirable to shorten.</p>
<p>The new art conquered the old. The whole life of Florence was
soon painted as it was: the face of the town, the streets, the
churches, the towers, the winding river, the mountains round about
it; the country, the fields and hills and hamlets, the peasants at
work, ploughing, sowing, and gathering fruit, the cattle feeding,
the birds among the trees and in the sky; nobles and rich burghers
hunting, hawking; the magistrates, the citizens, the street-boys,
the fine ladies, the tradesmen's wives, the heads of the guilds;
the women visiting their friends; the interior of the houses. We
may see this art of human life in the apse of Santa Maria Novella,
painted by the hand of Ghirlandajo: in the Riccardi Palace, painted
by Benozzo Gozzoli; in more than half the pictures of the painters
who succeeded Fra Lippo Lippi. Only, so much of the old clings that
all this actual Florentine life is painted into the ancient
religious subjects&mdash;the life of the Baptist and the Virgin,
the embassage of the Wise Men, the life of Christ, the legends of
the saints, the lives of the virgins and martyrs, Jerusalem and its
life painted as if it were Florence and its life&mdash;all the
spiritual religion gone out of it, it is true, but yet, another
kind of religion budding in it&mdash;the religion, not of the
monastery, but of daily common life.</p>
<div class='poem'>

<p class='i12'>the world</p>

not only understand their own life better because they see, through

Art interprets to man all that is, and God in it.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>He could not do it; the time was not ripe enough. But he began
it. And the spirit of its coming breaks out in all he did.</p>
<p>We take a leap of more than half a century when we pass from
<i>Fra Lippo Lippi</i> to <i>Andrea del Sarto</i>. That advance in
art to which Lippo Lippi looked forward with a kind of rage at his
own powerlessness had been made. In its making, the art of the
Renaissance had painted men and women, both body and soul, in every
kind of life, both of war and peace; and better than they had ever
been painted before. Having fulfilled that, the painters asked,
"What more? What new thing shall we do? What new aim shall we
pursue?" And there arose among them a desire to paint all that was
paintable, and especially the human body, with scientific
perfection. "In our desire to paint the whole of life, we have
produced so much that we were forced to paint carelessly or
inaccurately. In our desire to be original, we have neglected
technique. In our desire to paint the passions <a name='Page311'
id="Page311"></a><span class='pagenum'>311</span>on the face and in
the movements of men, we have lost the calm and harmony of the
ancient classic work, which made its ethical impression of the
perfect balance of the divine nature by the ideal arrangement, in
accord with a finished science, of the various members of the body
to form a finished whole. Let the face no longer then try to
represent the individual soul. One type of face for each class of
art-representation is enough. Let our effort be to represent beauty
by the perfect drawing of the body in repose and in action, and by
chosen attitudes and types. Let our composition follow certain
guiding lines and rules, in accordance with whose harmonies all
pictures shall be made. We will follow the Greek; compose as he
did, and by his principles; and for that purpose make a scientific
study of the body of man; observing in all painting, sculpture, and
architecture the general forms and proportions that ancient art,
after many experiments, selected as the best. And, to match that,
we must have perfect drawing in all we do."</p>
<p>This great change, which, as art's adulterous connection with
science deepened, led to such unhappy results, Browning represents,
when its aim had been reached, in his poem, <i>Andrea del
Sarto</i>; and he tells us&mdash;through Andrea's talk with his
wife Lucretia&mdash;what he thought of it; and what Andrea himself,
whose broken life may have opened his eyes to the truth of things,
may himself have thought of it. On that element in the poem I have
already dwelt, and shall only touch on the scenery and tragedy, of
the piece:</p>
<p>We sit with Andrea, looking out to Fiesole.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'><a name='Page312' id="Page312"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>312</p>
<p class='i12'>sober, pleasant Fiesole.</p>
<p>There's the bell clinking from the chapel top;</p>
<p>That length of convent-wall across the way</p>
<p>Holds the trees safer, huddled more inside;</p>
<p>The last monk leaves the garden; days decrease,</p>
<p>And autumn grows, autumn in everything.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the poem goes on, the night falls, falls with the deepening
of the painter's depression; the owls cry from the hill, Florence
wears the grey hue of the heart of Andrea; and Browning weaves the
autumn and the night into the tragedy of the painter's life.</p>
<p>That tragedy was pitiful. Andrea del Sarto was a faultless
painter and a weak character; and it fell to his lot to love with
passion a faithless woman. His natural weakness was doubled by the
weakness engendered by unconquerable passion; and he ruined his
life, his art, and his honour, to please his wife. He wearied her,
as women are wearied, by passion unaccompanied by power; and she
endured him only while he could give her money and pleasures. She
despised him for that endurance, and all the more that he knew she
was guilty, but said nothing lest she should leave him. Browning
fills his main subject&mdash;his theory of the true aim of
art&mdash;with this tragedy; and his treatment of it is a fine
example of his passionate humanity; and the passion of it is
knitted up with close reasoning and illuminated by his intellectual
play.</p>
<p>It is worth a reader's while to read, along with this poem,
Alfred de Musset's short play, <i>Andr&eacute; del Sarto</i>. The
tragedy of the situation is deepened by the French poet, and the
end is told. Unlike Browning, only a few lines sketch the time, its
temper, and its art. It is the depth of the tragedy which De Musset
paints, and that alone; <a name='Page313' id=
"Page313"></a><span class='pagenum'>313</span>and in order to
deepen it, Andrea is made a much nobler character than he is in
Browning's poem. The betrayal is also made more complete, more
overwhelming. Lucretia is false to Andrea with his favourite pupil,
with Cordiani, to whom he had given all he had, whom he loved
almost as much as he loved his wife. Terrible, inevitable Fate
broods over this brief and masterly little play.</p>
<p>The next of these imaginative representations of the Renaissance
is, <i>The Bishop orders his Tomb at St. Praxed's Church</i>. We
are placed in the full decadence of the Renaissance. Its total loss
of religion, even in the Church; its immorality&mdash;the bishop's
death-bed is surrounded by his natural sons and the wealth he
leaves has been purchased by every kind of iniquity&mdash;its pride
of life; its luxury; its semi-Paganism; its imitative classicism;
its inconsistency; its love of jewels, and fine stones, and rich
marbles; its jealousy and envy; its pleasure in the adornment of
death; its delight in the outsides of things, in mere workmanship;
its loss of originality; its love of scholarship for scholarship's
sake alone; its contempt of the common people; its
exhaustion&mdash;are one and all revealed or suggested in this
astonishing poem.</p>
<p>These are the three greater poems dedicated to this period; but
there are some minor poems which represent different phases of its
life. One of these is the <i>Pictor Ignotus</i>. There must have
been many men, during the vital time of the Renaissance, who, born,
as it were, into the art-ability of the period, reached without
trouble a certain level in painting, but who had no genius, who
could not create; or who, if they had some touch of genius, had no
<a name='Page314' id="Page314"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>314</span>boldness to strike it into fresh forms of
beauty; shy, retiring men, to whom the criticism of the world was a
pain they knew they could not bear. These men are common at a
period when life is racing rapidly through the veins of a vivid
city like Florence. The general intensity of the life lifts them to
a height they would never reach in a dull and sleepy age. The life
they have is not their own, but the life of the whole town. And
this keen perception of life outside of them persuades them that
they can do all that men of real power can do. In reality, they can
do nothing and make nothing worth a people's honour. Browning, who
himself was compact of boldness, who loved experiment in what was
new, and who shaped what he conceived without caring for criticism,
felt for these men, of whom he must have met many; and, asking
himself "How they would think; what they would do; and how life
would seem to them," wrote this poem. In what way will poor human
nature excuse itself for failure? How will the weakness in the man
try to prove that it was power? How, having lost the joy of life,
will he attempt to show that his loss is gain, his failure a
success; and, being rejected of the world, approve himself
within?</p>
<p>This was a subject to please Browning; meat such as his soul
loved: a nice, involved, D&aelig;dalian, labyrinthine sort of
thing, a mixture of real sentiment and self-deceit; and he
surrounded it with his pity for its human weakness.</p>
<p>"I could have painted any picture that I pleased," cries this
painter; "represented on the face any passion, any virtue." If he
could he would have done it, or tried it. Genius cannot hold itself
in.</p>
<p>"<a name='Page315' id="Page315"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>315</span>I have dreamed of sending forth some picture
which should enchant the world (and he alludes to Cimabue's
picture)&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Bound for some great state,</p>
<p>Or glad aspiring little burgh, it went&mdash;</p>
<p>Flowers cast upon the car which bore the freight,</p>
<p>Through old streets named afresh from the event.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>"That would have been, had I willed it. But mixed with the
praisers there would have been cold, critical faces; judges who
would press on me and mock. And I&mdash;I could not bear it." Alas!
had he had genius, no fear would have stayed his hand, no judgment
of the world delayed his work. What stays a river breaking from its
fountain-head?</p>
<p>So he sank back, saying the world was not worthy of his labours.
"What? Expose my noble work (things he had conceived but not done)
to the prate and pettiness of the common buyers who hang it on
their walls! No, I will rather paint the same monotonous round of
Virgin, Child, and Saints in the quiet church, in the sanctuary's
gloom. No merchant then will traffic in my heart. My pictures will
moulder and die. Let them die. I have not vulgarised myself or
them." Brilliant and nobly wrought as the first three poems are of
which I have written, this quiet little piece needed and received a
finer workmanship, and was more difficult than they.</p>
<p>Then there is <i>How it strikes a Contemporary</i>&mdash;the
story of the gossip of a Spanish town about a poor poet, who,
because he wanders everywhere about the streets observing all
things, is mistaken for a spy of the king. The long pages he writes
are said to be letters to the king; the misfortunes <a name=
'Page316' id="Page316"></a><span class='pagenum'>316</span>of this
or that man are caused by his information. The world thinks him a
wonder of cleverness; he is but an inferior poet. It imagines that
he lives in Assyrian luxury; he lives and dies in a naked garret.
This imaginative representation might be of any time in a
provincial town of an ignorant country like Spain. It is a slight
study of what superstitious imagination and gossip will work up
round any man whose nature and manners, like those of a poet,
isolate him from the common herd. Force is added to this study by
its scenery. The Moorish windows, the shops, the gorgeous
magistrates pacing down the promenade, are touched in with a flying
pencil; and then, moving through the crowd, the lean, black-coated
figure, with his cane and dog and his peaked hat, clear flint eyes
and beaked nose, is seen, as if alive, in the vivid sunshine of
Valladolid. But what Browning wished most to describe in this poem
was one of the first marks of a poet, even of a poor one like this
gentleman&mdash;the power of seeing and observing everything.
Nothing was too small, nothing uninteresting in this man's eyes.
His very hat was scrutinising.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>He stood and watched the cobbler at his trade,</p>
<p>The man who slices lemons into drink,</p>
<p>The coffee-roaster's brazier, and the boys</p>
<p>That volunteer to help him turn its winch.</p>
<p>He glanced o'er books on stalls with half an eye,</p>
<p>And fly-leaf ballads on the vendor's string,</p>
<p>And broad-edged bold-print posters by the wall.</p>
<p>He took such cognisance of man and things,</p>
<p>If any beat a horse you felt he saw;</p>
<p>If any cursed a woman, he took note;</p>
<p>Yet stared at nobody, you stared at him,</p>
<p>And found, less to your pleasure than surprise,</p>
<p>He seemed to know you and expect as much.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page317' id="Page317"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>317</span>That is the artist's way. It was Browning's
way. He is describing himself. In that fashion he roamed through
Venice or Florence, stopping every moment, attracted by the
smallest thing, finding a poem in everything, lost in himself yet
seeing all that surrounded him, isolated in thinking, different
from and yet like the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Another poem&mdash;<i>My Last Duchess</i>&mdash;must be
mentioned. It is plainly placed in the midst of the period of the
Renaissance by the word <i>Ferrara</i>, which is added to its
title. But it is rather a picture of two temperaments which may
exist in any cultivated society, and at any modern time. There are
numbers of such men as the Duke and such women as the Duchess in
our midst. Both are, however, drawn with mastery. Browning has
rarely done his work with more insight, with greater keenness of
portraiture, with happier brevity and selection. As in <i>The
Flight of the Duchess</i>, untoward fate has bound together two
temperaments sure to clash with each other&mdash;and no gipsy comes
to deliver the woman in this case. The man's nature kills her. It
happens every day. The Renaissance society may have built up more
men of this type than ours, but they are not peculiar to it.</p>
<p>Germany, not Italy, is, I think, the country in which Browning
intended to place two other poems which belong to the time of the
Renaissance&mdash;<i>Johannes Agricola in Meditation</i> and <i>A
Grammarian's Funeral</i>. Their note is as different from that of
the Italian poems as the national temper of Germany is from that of
Italy. They have no sense of beauty for beauty's sake alone. Their
atmosphere is not soft or gay but somewhat stern. The logical
<a name='Page318' id="Page318"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>318</span>arrangement of them is less one of feeling than
of thought. There is a stronger manhood in them, a grimmer view of
life. The sense of duty to God and Man, but little represented in
the Italian poems of the Renaissance, does exist in these two
German poems. Moreover, there is in them a full representation of
aspiration to the world beyond. But the Italian Renaissance lived
for the earth alone, and its loveliness; too close to earth to care
for heaven.</p>
<p>It pleased Browning to throw himself fully into the soul of
Johannes Agricola; and he does it with so much personal fervour
that it seems as if, in one of his incarnations, he had been the
man, and, for the moment of his writing, was dominated by him. The
mystic-passion fills the poetry with keen and dazzling light, and
it is worth while, from this point of view, to compare the poem
with Tennyson's <i>Sir Galahad</i>, and on another side, with
<i>St. Simeon Stylites</i>.</p>
<p>Johannes Agricola was one of the products of the reforming
spirit of the sixteenth century in Germany, one of its wild
extremes. He believes that God had chosen him among a few to be his
for ever and for his own glory from the foundation of the world. He
did not say that all sin was permitted to the saints, that what the
flesh did was no matter, like those wild fanatics, one of whom
Scott draws in <i>Woodstock</i>; but he did say, that if he sinned
it made no matter to his election by God. Nay, the immanence of God
in him turned the poison to health, the filth to jewels. Goodness
and badness make no matter; God's choice is all. The martyr for
truth, the righteous man whose life has saved the world, but who is
not elected, is damned for <a name='Page319' id=
"Page319"></a><span class='pagenum'>319</span>ever in burning hell.
"I am eternally chosen; for that I praise God. I do not understand
it. If I did, could I praise Him? But I know my settled place in
the divine decrees." I quote the beginning. It is pregnant with
superb spiritual audacity, and kindled with imaginative pride.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>There's heaven above, and night by night</p>
<p class='i2'>I look right through its gorgeous roof;</p>
<p>No suns and moons though e'er so bright</p>
<p class='i2'>Avail to stop me; splendour-proof</p>
<p class='i2'>Keep the broods of stars aloof:</p>
<p>For I intend to get to God,</p>
<p class='i2'>For 'tis to God I speed so fast,</p>
<p>For in God's breast, my own abode,</p>
<p class='i2'>Those shoals of dazzling glory, passed,</p>
<p class='i2'>I lay my spirit down at last.</p>
<p>I lie where I have always lain,</p>
<p class='i2'>God smiles as he has always smiled;</p>
<p>Ere suns and moons could wax and wane,</p>
<p class='i2'>Ere stars were thunder-girt, or piled</p>
<p class='i2'>The heavens, God thought on me his child;</p>
<p>Ordained a life for me, arrayed</p>
<p class='i2'>Its circumstances every one</p>
<p>To the minutest; ay, God said</p>
<p class='i2'>This head this hand should rest upon</p>
<p class='i2'>Thus, ere he fashioned star or sun.</p>
<p>And having thus created me,</p>
<p class='i2'>Thus rooted me, he bade me grow,</p>
<p>Guiltless for ever, like a tree</p>
<p class='i2'>That buds and blooms, nor seeks to know</p>
<p class='i2'>The law by which it prospers so:</p>
<p>But sure that thought and word and deed</p>
<p class='i2'>All go to swell his love for me,</p>
<p>Me, made because that love had need</p>
<p class='i2'>Of something irreversibly</p>
<p class='i2'>Pledged solely its content to be.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As to <i>A Grammarian's Funeral</i>, that poem also belongs to
the German rather than to the Italian spirit. The Renaissance in
Italy lost its religion; at the same time, in Germany, it added a
reformation <a name='Page320' id="Page320"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>320</span>of religion to the New Learning. The
Renaissance in Italy desired the fulness of knowledge in this
world, and did not look for its infinities in the world beyond. In
Germany the same desire made men call for the infinities of
knowledge beyond the earth. A few Italians, like Savonarola, like
M. Angelo, did the same, and failed to redeem their world; but
eternal aspiration dwelt in the soul of every German who had gained
a religion. In Italy, as the Renaissance rose to its luxury and
trended to its decay, the pull towards personal righteousness made
by belief in an omnipotent goodness who demands the subjection of
our will to his, ceased to be felt by artists, scholars and
cultivated society. A man's will was his only law. On the other
hand, the life of the New Learning in Germany and England was
weighted with a sense of duty to an eternal Righteousness. The love
of knowledge or beauty was modified into seriousness of life,
carried beyond this life in thought, kept clean, and, though filled
with incessant labour on the earth, aspired to reach its fruition
only in the life to come.</p>
<p>This is the spirit and the atmosphere of the <i>Grammarian's
Funeral</i>, and Browning's little note at the beginning says that
its time "was shortly after the revival of learning in Europe." I
have really no proof that Browning laid the scene of his poem in
Germany, save perhaps the use of such words as "thorp" and "croft,"
but there is a clean, pure morning light playing through the verse,
a fresh, health-breathing northern air, which does not fit in with
Italy; a joyous, buoyant youthfulness in the song and march of the
students who carry their <a name='Page321' id=
"Page321"></a><span class='pagenum'>321</span>master with gay
strength up the mountain to the very top, all of them filled with
his aspiring spirit, all of them looking forward with gladness and
vigour to life&mdash;which has no relation whatever to the temper
of Florentine or Roman life during the age of the Medici. The bold
brightness, moral earnestness, pursuit of the ideal, spiritual
intensity, reverence for good work and for the man who did it,
which breathe in the poem, differ by a whole world from the
atmosphere of life in <i>Andrea del Sarto</i>. This is a crowd of
men who are moving upwards, who, seizing the Renaissance elements,
knitted them through and through with reformation of life, faith in
God, and hope for man. They had a future and knew it. The
semi-paganism of the Renaissance had not, and did not know it had
not.</p>
<p>We may close this series of Renaissance representations by <i>A
Toccata of Galuppi's</i>. It cannot take rank with the others as a
representative poem. It is of a different class; a changeful dream
of images and thoughts which came to Browning as he was playing a
piece of eighteenth-century Venetian music. But in the dream there
is a sketch of that miserable life of fruitless pleasure, the other
side of which was dishonourable poverty, into which Venetian
society had fallen in the eighteenth century. To this the pride,
the irreligion, the immorality, the desire of knowledge and beauty
for their own sake alone, had brought the noblest, wisest, and most
useful city in Italy. That part of the poem is representative. It
is the end of such a society as is drawn in <i>The Bishop orders
his Tomb at St. Praxed's Church</i>. That tomb is placed in Rome,
but it is in Venice that <a name='Page322' id=
"Page322"></a><span class='pagenum'>322</span>this class of tombs
reached their greatest splendour of pride, opulence, folly,
debasement and irreligion.</p>
<p>Finally, there are a few poems which paint the thoughts, the
sorrows, the pleasures, and the political passions of modern Italy.
There is the <i>Italian in England</i>, full of love for the
Italian peasant and of pity for the patriot forced to live and die
far from his motherland. Mazzini used to read it to his
fellow-exiles to show them how fully an English poet could enter
into the temper of their soul. So far it may be said to represent a
type. But it scarcely comes under the range of this chapter. But
<i>Up in a Villa, down in the City</i>, is so vivid a
representation of all that pleased a whole type of the city-bred
and poor nobles of Italy at the time when Browning wrote the
<i>Dramatic Lyrics</i> that I cannot omit it. It is an admirable
piece of work, crowded with keen descriptions of nature in the
Casentino, and of life in the streets of Florence. And every piece
of description is so filled with the character of the "Italian
person of quality" who describes them&mdash;a petulant, humorous,
easily angered, happy, observant, ignorant, poor
gentleman&mdash;that Browning entirely disappears. The poem retains
for us in its verse, and indeed in its light rhythm, the
childlikeness, the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, the simple
pleasures, the ignorance, and the honest boredom with the solitudes
of nature&mdash;of a whole class of Italians, not only of the time
when it was written, but of the present day. It is a delightful,
inventive piece of gay and pictorial humour.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIII' id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3><i>WOMANHOOD IN BROWNING</i></h3>
<p>The first woman we meet in Browning's poetry is Pauline; a
twofold person, exceedingly unlike the woman usually made by a
young poet. She is not only the Pauline idealised and also
materialised by the selfish passion of her lover, but also the real
woman whom Browning has conceived underneath the lover's image of
her. This doubling of his personages, as seen under two diverse
aspects or by two different onlookers, in the same poem, is not
unfrequent in his poetry, and it pleased his intellect to make
these efforts. When the thing was well done, its cleverness was
amazing, even imaginative; when it was ill done, it was confusing.
Tennyson never did this; he had not analytic power enough. What he
sees of his personages is all one, quite clearly drawn and easy to
understand. But we miss in them, and especially in his women, the
intellectual play, versatility and variety of Browning. Tennyson's
women sometimes border on dulness, are without that movement,
change and surprises, which in women disturb mankind for evil or
for good. If Tennyson had had a little more of Browning's
imaginative analysis, and Browning a little less of it, both would
have been better artists.</p>
<p><a name='Page324' id="Page324"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>324</span>The Pauline of the lover is the commonplace
woman whom a young man so often invents out of a woman for his use
and pleasure. She is to be his salvation, to sympathise with his
ideals, joys and pains, to give him everything, with herself, and
to live for him and him alone. Nothing can be more <i>na&iuml;f</i>
and simple than this common selfishness which forgets that a woman
has her own life, her own claim on the man, and her own
individuality to develop; and this element in the poem, which never
occurs again in Browning's poetry, may be the record of an early
experience. If so, he had escaped from this youthful error before
he had finished the poem, and despised it, perhaps too much. It is
excusable and natural in the young. His contempt for this kind of
love is embodied in the second Pauline. She is not the woman her
lover imagines her to be, but far older and more experienced than
her lover; who has known long ago what love was; who always liked
to be loved, who therefore suffers her lover to expatiate as wildly
as he pleases; but whose life is quite apart from him, enduring him
with pleasurable patience, criticising him, wondering how he can be
so excited. There is a dim perception in the lover's phrases of
these elements in his mistress' character; and that they are in her
character is quite plain from the patronising piece of criticism in
French which Browning has put into her mouth. The first touch of
his humour appears in the contrast of the gentle and lofty boredom
of the letter with the torrents of love in the poem. And if we may
imagine that the lover is partly an image of what Browning once
felt in a youthful love, we <a name='Page325' id=
"Page325"></a><span class='pagenum'>325</span>may also think that
the making of the second and critical Pauline was his record, when
his love had passed, of what he thought about it all.</p>
<p>This mode of treatment, so much more analytic than imaginative,
belongs to Browning as an artist. He seems, while he wrote, as if
half of him sat apart from the personages he was making,
contemplating them in his observant fashion, discussing them coolly
in his mind while the other half of him wrote about them with
emotion; placing them in different situations and imagining what
they would then do; inventing trials for them and recombining,
through these trials, the elements of their characters; arguing
about and around them, till he sometimes loses the unity of their
personality. This is a weakness in his work when he has to create
characters in a drama who may be said, like Shakespeare's, to have,
once he has created them, a life of their own independent of the
poet. His spinning of his own thoughts about their characters makes
us often realise, in his dramas, the individuality of Browning more
than the individuality of the characters. We follow him at this
work with keen intellectual pleasure, but we do not always follow
him with a passionate humanity.</p>
<p>On the contrary, this habit, which was one cause of his weakness
as an artist in the drama, increased his strength as an artist when
he made single pictures of men and women at isolated crises in
their lives; or when he pictured them as they seemed at the moment
to one, two, or three differently tempered persons&mdash;pictorial
sketches and studies which we may hang up in the chambers of the
mind for meditation or discussion. Their <a name='Page326' id=
"Page326"></a><span class='pagenum'>326</span>intellectual power
and the emotional interest they awaken, the vivid imaginative
lightning which illuminates them in flashes, arise out of that part
of his nature which made him a weak dramatist.</p>
<p>Had he chosen, for example, to paint Lady Carlisle as he
conceived her, in an isolated portrait, and in the same
circumstances as in his drama of <i>Strafford</i>, we should have
had a clear and intimate picture of her moving, alive at every
point, amidst the decay and shipwreck of the Court. But in the play
she is a shade who comes and goes, unoutlined, confused and
confusing, scarcely a woman at all. The only clear hints of what
Browning meant her to be are given in the <i>asides</i> of
Strafford.</p>
<p>Browning may have been content with <i>Strafford</i> as a whole,
but, with his passion for vitality, he could not have been content
with either Lady Carlisle or the Queen as representatives of women.
Indeed, up to this point, when he had written <i>Pauline</i>,
<i>Paracelsus</i> and <i>Strafford</i>, he must have felt that he
had left out of his poetry one half of the human race; and his
ambition was to represent both men and women. Pauline's chief
appearance is in French prose. Michel, in <i>Paracelsus</i>, is a
mere silhouette of the sentimental German Frau, a soft sympathiser
with her husband and with the young eagle Paracelsus, who longs to
leave the home she would not leave for the world&mdash;an excellent
and fruitful mother. She is set in a pleasant garden landscape.
Twice Browning tries to get more out of her and to lift her into
reality. But the men carry him away from her, and she remains
undrawn. These mere images, with the exception of the woman in
<i>Porphyria's Lover</i>, who, with a <a name='Page327' id=
"Page327"></a><span class='pagenum'>327</span>boldness which might
have astonished even Byron but is characteristic of Browning in his
audacious youth, leaves the ball to visit her lover in the cottage
in the garden&mdash;are all that he had made of womanhood in 1837,
four years after he had begun to publish poetry.</p>
<p>It was high time he should do something better, and he had now
begun to know more of the variousness of women and of their
resolute grip on life and affairs. So, in <i>Sordello</i>, he
created Palma. She runs through the poem, and her appearances mark
turning points in Sordello's development; but thrice she appears in
full colour and set in striking circumstances&mdash;first, in the
secret room of the palace at Verona with Sordello when she expounds
her policy, and afterwards leans with him amid a gush of torch-fire
over the balcony, whence the grey-haired councillors spoke to the
people surging in the square and shouting for the battle. The
second time is in the streets of Ferrara, full of camping men and
fires; and the third is when she waits with Taurello in the vaulted
room below the chamber where Sordello has been left to decide what
side he shall take, for the Emperor or the Pope. He dies while they
wait, but there is no finer passage in the poem than this of Palma
and Taurello talking in the dim corridor of the new world they
would make for North Italy with Sordello. It is not dramatic
characterisation, but magnificent individualisation of the woman
and the man.</p>
<p>We see Palma first as a girl at Goito, where she fills Sordello
with dreams, and Browning gives her the beauty of the Venetians
Titian painted.</p>

<p class='i12'>How the tresses curled</p>
<p>Into a sumptuous swell of gold and wound</p>
<p>About her like a glory! even the ground</p>
<p>Was bright as with spilt sunbeams:</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Full consciousness of her beauty is with her, frank triumph in
it; but she is still a child. At the Court of Love she is a woman,
not only conscious of her loveliness, but able to use it to bind
and loose, having sensuous witchery and intellectual power, that
terrible combination. She lays her magic on Sordello.</p>
<p>But she is not only the woman of personal magic and beauty.
Being of high rank and mixed with great events, she naturally
becomes the political woman, a common type in the thirteenth
century. And Browning gives her the mental power to mould and
direct affairs. She uses her personal charm to lure Sordello into
politics.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Her wise</p>
<p>And lulling words are yet about the room,</p>
<p>Her presence wholly poured upon the gloom</p>
<p>Down even to her vesture's creeping stir.</p>

<hr class='short' />
<p>But when she felt she held her friend indeed</p>
<p>Safe, she threw back her curls, began implant</p>
<p>Her lessons;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Her long discourse on the state of parties, and how Sordello
may, in mastering them, complete his being, fascinates him and us
by the charm of her intelligence.</p>
<p>But the political woman has often left love behind. Politics,
like devotion, are a woman's reaction from the weariness of loving
and being loved. But Palma is young, and in the midst of <a name=
'Page329' id="Page329"></a><span class='pagenum'>329</span>her
politics she retains passion, sentiment, tenderness and charm. She
dreams of some soul beyond her own, who, coming, should call on all
the force in her character; enable her, in loving him, to give
consummation to her work for Italy; and be himself the hand and
sword of her mind. Therefore she held herself in leash till the
right man came, till she loved. "Waits he not," her heart cries,
and mixes him with coming Spring:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Waits he not the waking year?</p>
<p>His almond blossoms must be honey-ripe</p>
<p>By this; to welcome him, fresh runnels stripe</p>
<p>The thawed ravines; because of him, the wind</p>
<p>Walks like a herald. I shall surely find</p>
<p>Him now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>She finds him in Sordello, and summons him, when the time is
ripe, to Verona. Love and ambition march together in her now. In
and out of all her schemes Sordello moves. The glory of her vision
of North Italian rule is like a halo round his brow. Not one
political purpose is lost, but all are transfigured in her by love.
Softness and strength, intellect and feeling meet in her. This is a
woman nobly carved, and the step from Michel, Pauline and Lady
Carlisle to her is an immense one.</p>
<p>By exercise of his powers Browning's genius had swiftly
developed. There comes a time, sooner or later, to a great poet
when, after many experiments, the doors of his intellect and soul
fly open, and his genius is flooded with the action and thought of
what seems a universe. And with this revelation of Man and Nature,
a tidal wave of creative power, new and impelling, carries the poet
far beyond the station where last he rested. It came to Browning
<a name='Page330' id="Page330"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>330</span>now. The creation of Palma would be enough to
prove it, but there is not a character or scene in <i>Sordello</i>
which does not also prove it.</p>
<hr class='short' />
<p>In this new outrush of his genius he created a very different
woman from Palma. He created Pippa, the Asolan girl, at the other
end of society from Palma, at the other end of feminine character.
Owing to the host of new thoughts which in this early summer of
genius came pouring into his soul&mdash;all of which he tried to
express, rejecting none, choosing none out of the rest, expressing
only half of a great number of them; so delighted with them all
that he could leave none out&mdash;he became obscure in
<i>Sordello</i>. Owing also to the great complexity of the
historical <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> in which he placed his
characters in that poem, he also became obscure. Had he been an
experienced artist he would have left out at least a third of the
thoughts and scenes he inserted. As it was, he threw all his
thoughts and all the matters he had learnt about the politics,
cities, architecture, customs, war, gardens, religion and poetry of
North Italy in the thirteenth century, pell-mell into this poem,
and left them, as it were, to find their own places. This was very
characteristic of a young man when the pot of his genius was
boiling over. Nothing bolder, more incalculable, was ever done by a
poet in the period of his storm and stress. The boundless and to
express it, was never sought with more audacity. It was impossible,
in this effort, for him to be clear, and we need not be vexed with
him. The daring, the rush, the unconsciousness and the youth of it
all, are his excuse, but not his praise. And when the <a name=
'Page331' id="Page331"></a><span class='pagenum'>331</span>public
comes to understand that the dimness and complexity of
<i>Sordello</i> arise from plenteousness not scarcity of thought,
and that they were not a pose of the poet's but the natural leaping
of a full fountain just let loose from its mountain chamber, it
will have a personal liking, not perhaps for the poem but for
Browning. "I will not read the book," it will say, "but I am glad
he had it in him."</p>
<p>Still it was an artistic failure, and when Browning understood
that the public could not comprehend him&mdash;and we must remember
that he desired to be comprehended, for he loved mankind&mdash;he
thought he would use his powers in a simpler fashion, and please
the honest folk. So, in the joy of having got rid in
<i>Sordello</i> of so many of his thoughts by expression and of
mastering the rest; and determined, since he had been found
difficult, to be the very opposite&mdash;loving contrast like a
poet&mdash;he wrote <i>Pippa Passes</i>. I need not describe its
plan. Our business is with the women in it.</p>
<p>Ottima, alive with carnal passion, in the fire of which the
murder of her husband seems a mere incident, is an audacious
sketch, done in splashes of ungradated colour. Had Browning been
more in the woman's body and soul he would not have done her in
jerks as he has done. Her trick of talking of the landscape, as if
she were on a holiday like Pippa, is not as subtly conceived or
executed as it should be, and is too far away from her dominant
carnality to be natural. And her sensualism is too coarse for her
position. A certain success is attained, but the imagination is
frequently jarred. The very outburst of unsensual love at the end,
when her love passes from the <a name='Page332' id=
"Page332"></a><span class='pagenum'>332</span>flesh into the
spirit, when self-sacrifice dawns upon her and she begins to suffer
the first agonies of redemption, is plainly more due to the poet's
pity than to the woman's spirit. Again, Sebald is the first to feel
remorse after the murder. Ottima only begins to feel it when she
thinks her lover is ceasing to love her. I am not sure that to
reverse the whole situation would not be nearer to the truth of
things; but that is matter of discussion. Then the subject-matter
is sordid. Nothing relieves the coarseness of Sebald, Ottima and
Luca and their relations to one another but the few descriptions of
nature and the happy flash of innocence when Pippa passes by. Nor
are there any large fates behind the tale or large effects to
follow which might lift the crime into dignity. This mean,
commonplace, ugly kind of subject had a strange attraction for
Browning, as we see in <i>The Inn Album</i>, in <i>Red Cotton
Nightcap Country</i>, and elsewhere. I may add that it is curious
to find him, in 1841, writing exactly like a modern realist, nearly
fifty years before realism of this kind had begun. And this
illustrates what I have said of the way in which he anticipated by
so many years the kind of work to which the literary world should
come. The whole scene between Sebald and Ottima might have been
written by a powerful, relentless modern novelist.</p>
<p>We have more of this realism, but done with great skill,
humanity, even tenderness, in the meeting and talk of the young
harlotry on the steps of the Duomo near the fountain. When we think
of this piece of bold, clear, impressionist reality cast into the
midst of the proprieties of literature in <a name='Page333' id=
"Page333"></a><span class='pagenum'>333</span>1841, it is
impossible not to wonder and smile. The girls are excellently drawn
and varied from each other. Browning's pity gathers round them, and
something of underlying purity, of natural grace of soul, of
tenderness in memory of their youth emerges in them; and the charm
of their land is round their ways. There was also in his mind, I
think, a sense of picturesqueness in their class when they were
young, which, mingling with his pity for them, attracted his
imagination, or touched into momentary life that roving element in
a poet which resents the barriers made by social and domestic
purity. <i>Fifine at the Fair</i> is partly a study of that temper
which comes and goes, goes and comes in the life not only of poets
but of ordinary men and women.</p>
<p>Then, to illustrate this further, there is in <i>Sordello</i> a
brilliant sketch of girls of this kind at Venice, full of sunlight,
colour and sparkling water, in which he has seen these butterflies
of women as a painter would see them, or as a poet who, not
thinking then of moral questions or feeling pity for their fate, is
satisfied for the flying moment with the picture they make, with
the natural freedom of their life.</p>
<p>But he does not leave that picture without a representation of
the other side of this class of womanhood. It was a daring thing,
when he wished to say that he would devote his whole work to the
love and representation of humanity to symbolise it by a sorrowful
street-girl in Venice who wistfully asks an alms; worn and broken
with sorrow and wrong; whose eyes appeal for pity, for
comprehension of her good and for his <a name='Page334' id=
"Page334"></a><span class='pagenum'>334</span>love; and whose
fascination and beauty are more to him than those of her
unsuffering companions. The other side of that class of women is
here given with clear truth and just compassion, and the
representation is lifted into imaginative strength, range and
dignity of thought and feeling by her being made the image of the
whole of humanity. "This woman," he thought, "is humanity, whom I
love, who asks the poet in me to reveal her as she is, a divine
seed of God to find some day its flowering&mdash;the broken harlot
of the universe, who will be, far off, the Magdalen redeemed by her
ineradicable love. That, and with every power I have, I will, as
poet, love and represent."</p>
<p>This is the imagination working at its best, with its most
penetrative and passionate power, and Browning is far greater as a
poet in this Thing of his, where thought and love are knit into
union to give birth to moral, intellectual and spiritual beauty,
than he is in those lighter and cleverer poems in which he sketches
with a facile but too discursive a pencil, the transient moments,
grave or light, of the lives of women. Yet this and they show his
range, his variety, the embracing of his sympathy.</p>
<p>Over against these girls in the market-place, against Ottima in
her guilt, and Phene who is as yet a nonentity (her speech to the
sculptor is too plainly Browning's analysis of the moment, not her
own thinking&mdash;no girl of fourteen brought up by Natalia would
talk in that fashion) is set Pippa, the light, life and love of the
day, the town, the people and the poem. She passes like an angel by
and touches with her wing events and persons and changes them to
good. She has some natural <a name='Page335' id=
"Page335"></a><span class='pagenum'>335</span>genius, and is as
unconscious of her genius as she is of the good she does. In her
unconsciousness is the fountain of her charm. She lives like a
flower of the field that knows not it has blest and comforted with
its beauty the travellers who have passed it by. She has only one
day in the whole year for her own, and for that day she creates a
fresh personality for herself. She clothes her soul, intellect,
imagination, and spiritual aspiration in holiday garments for the
day, becoming for the time a new poetic self, and able to choose
any other personality in Asolo from hour to hour&mdash;the queen
and spirit of the town; not wishing to be, actually, the folk she
passes by, but only, since she is so isolated, to be something in
their lives, to touch them for help and company.</p>
<p>The world of nature speaks to her and loves her. She sees all
that is beautiful, feeds on it, and grasps the matter of thought
that underlies the beauty. And so much is she at home with nature
that she is able to describe with ease in words almost as noble as
the thing itself the advent of the sun. When she leaps out of her
bed to meet the leap of the sun, the hymn of description she sings
might be sung by the Hours themselves as they dance round the car
of the god. She can even play with the great Mother as with an
equal, or like her child. The charming gaiety with which she speaks
to the sunlights that dance in her room, and to the flowers which
are her sisters, prove, however isolated her life may be, that she
is never alone. Along with this brightness she has seriousness, the
sister of her gaiety; the deep seriousness of imagination, the
seriousness also of the evening <a name='Page336' id=
"Page336"></a><span class='pagenum'>336</span>when meditation
broods over the day and its doings before sleep. These, with her
sweet humanity, natural piety, instinctive purity, compose her of
soft sunshine and soft shadow. Nor does her sadness at the close,
which is overcome by her trust in God, make her less but more dear
to us. She is a beautiful creation. There are hosts of happy women
like her. They are the salt of the earth. But few poets have made
so much of them and so happily, or sung about these birds of God so
well as Browning has in <i>Pippa Passes</i>.</p>
<p>That was in 1841. Pleased with his success in this half-lyrical,
half-dramatic piece, he was lured towards the drama again, and also
to try his hand at those short lyrics&mdash;records of transient
emotion on fanciful subjects&mdash;or records of short but intense
moments of thought or feeling. It is a pity that he did not give to
dramatic lyrics (in which species of poetry he is quite our first
master) the time he gave to dramas, in which he is not much better
than an amateur. Nevertheless, we cannot omit the women in the
dramas. I have already written of Lady Carlisle. Polyxena, in
<i>King Victor and King Charles</i>, is partly the political woman
and partly the sensible and loving wife of a strangely tempered
man. She is fairly done, but is not interesting. Good womanly
intelligence in affairs, good womanly support of her man; clear
womanly insight into men and into intrigue&mdash;a woman of whom
there are hundreds of thousands in every rank of life. In her, as
in so much of Browning's work, the intellect of the woman is of a
higher quality than the intellect of the man.</p>
<p>Next, among his women, is Anael in the <i>Return <a name=
'Page337' id="Page337"></a><span class='pagenum'>337</span>of the
Druses</i>, She is placed in too unnatural a situation to allow her
nature to have fair play. In the preternatural world her
superstition creates, she adores Djabal, murders the Prefect, and
dies by her own hand. She is, in that world, a study of a young
girl's enthusiasm for her faith and her country, and for the man
she thinks divine; and were the subject, so far as it relates to
her character, well or clearly wrought, she might be made
remarkable. As it is wrought, it is so intertwisted with complex
threads of thought and passion that any clear outline of her
character is lost. Both Djabal and she are like clouds illuminated
by flashes of sheet lightning which show an infinity of folds and
shapes of vapour in each cloud, but show them only for an instant;
and then, when the flashes come again, show new folds, new
involutions. The characters are not allowed by Browning to develop
themselves.</p>
<p>Anael, when she is in the preternatural world, loves Djabal as
an incarnation of the divine, but in the natural world of her
girlhood her heart goes out to the Knight of Malta who loves her.
The in-and-out of these two emotional states&mdash;one in the world
of religious enthusiasm, and one in her own womanhood, as they
cross and re-cross one another&mdash;is elaborated with merciless
analysis; and Anael's womanhood appears, not as a whole, but in
bits and scraps. How will this young girl, divided by two
contemporaneous emotions, one in the supernatural and one in the
natural world, act in a crisis of her life? Well, the first,
conquering the second, brings about her death the moment she tries
to transfer the second into the world of the <a name='Page338' id=
"Page338"></a><span class='pagenum'>338</span>first&mdash;her dim,
half-conscious love for Lois into her conscious adoration of
Djabal.</p>
<p>Mildred and Guendolen are the two women in <i>A Blot in the
'Scutcheon</i>. Guendolen is the incarnation of high-hearted
feminine commonsense, of clear insight into the truth of things,
born of the power of love in her. Amid all the weaknesses of the
personages and the plot; in the wildered situation made by a
confused clashing of pride and innocence and remorse, in which
Browning, as it were on purpose to make a display of his
intellectual ability, involves those poor folk&mdash;Guendolen is
the rock on which we can rest in peace; the woman of the world, yet
not worldly; full of experience, yet having gained by every
experience more of love; just and strong yet pitiful, and with a
healthy but compassionate contempt for the intelligence of the men
who belong to her.</p>
<p>Contrasted with her, and the quality of her love contrasted
also, is Mildred, the innocent child girl who loves for love's
sake, and continues to be lost in her love. But Browning's
presentation of her innocence, her love, is spoiled by the
over-remorse, shame and fear under whose power he makes her so
helpless. They are in the circumstances so unnaturally great that
they lower her innocence and love, and the natural courage of
innocence and love. These rise again to their first level, but it
is only the passion of her lover's death which restores them. And
when they recur, she is outside of girlhood. One touch of the
courage she shows in the last scene would have saved in the
previous scene herself, her lover, and her brother. The lie she
lets her brother infer when she allows him to think <a name=
'Page339' id="Page339"></a><span class='pagenum'>339</span>that the
lover she has confessed to is not the Earl, yet that she will marry
the Earl, degrades her altogether and justly in her brother's eyes,
and is so terribly out of tune with her character that I repeat I
cannot understand how Browning could invent that situation. It
spoils the whole presentation of the girl. It is not only out of
her character, it is out of nature. Indeed, in spite of the poetry,
in spite of the pathetic beauty of the last scene, Mildred and
Tresham are always over-heightened, over-strained beyond the
concert-pitch of nature. But the drawing of the woman's character
suffers more from this than the man's, even though Tresham, in the
last scene, is half turned into a woman. Sex seems to disappear in
that scene.</p>
<p>A different person is Colombe, the Duchess in <i>Colombe's
Birthday</i>. That play, as I have said, gets on, but it gets on
because Colombe moves every one in the play by her own motion. From
beginning to end of the action she is the fire and the soul of it.
Innocent, frank and brave, simple and constant among a group of
false and worldly courtiers, among whom she moves like the white
Truth, untouched as yet by love or by the fates of her position,
she is suddenly thrown into a whirlpool of affairs and of love; and
her simplicity, clearness of intelligence, unconscious rightness of
momentary feeling, which comes of her not thinking about her
feelings&mdash;that rare and precious element in
character&mdash;above all, her belief in love as the one worthy
thing in the world, bring her out of the whirlpool, unshipwrecked,
unstained by a single wave of ill-feeling or mean thinking, into a
quiet <a name='Page340' id="Page340"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>340</span>harbour of affection and of power. For she will
influence Berthold all his life long.</p>
<p>She is herself lovely. Valence loves her at sight. Her love for
Valence is born before she knows it, and the touch of jealousy,
which half reveals it to her, is happily wrought by Browning. When
she finds out that Valence did for love of her what she thought was
done for loyalty alone to her, she is a little revolted; her
single-heartedness is disappointed. She puts aside her growing
love, which she does not know as yet is love, and says she will
find out if Berthold wishes to marry her because he loves her, or
for policy. Berthold is as honest as she is, and tells her love has
nothing to do with the matter. The thought of an untrue life with
Berthold then sends her heart with a rush back to Valence, and she
chooses love and obscurity with Valence. It is the portrait of
incarnate truth, in vivid contrast to Constance, who is a liar in
grain.</p>
<p>Constance is the heroine of the fragment of a drama called <i>In
a Balcony</i>. Norbert, a young diplomat, has served the Queen, who
is fifty years old, for a year, all for the love of Constance, a
cousin and dependent of the Queen. He tells Constance he will now,
as his reward, ask the Queen for her hand. Constance says, "No;
that will ruin us both; temporise; tell the Queen, who is hungry
for love, that you love her; and that, as she cannot marry a
subject, you will be content with me, whom the Queen loves."
Norbert objects, and no wonder, to this lying business, but he does
it; and the Queen runs to Constance, crying, "I am loved, thank
God! I will throw everything <a name='Page341' id=
"Page341"></a><span class='pagenum'>341</span>aside and marry him.
I thought he loved you, but he loves me." Then Constance, wavering
from truth again, says that the Queen is right. Norbert does love
her. And this is supposed by some to be a noble self-sacrifice,
done in pity for the Queen. It is much more like jealousy.</p>
<p>Then, finding that all Norbert's future depends on the Queen,
she is supposed to sacrifice herself again, this time for Norbert's
sake. She will give him up to the Queen, for the sake of his
career; and she tells the Queen, before Norbert, that he has
confessed to her his love for the Queen&mdash;another lie! Norbert
is indignant&mdash;he may well be&mdash;and throws down all this
edifice of falsehood. The Queen knows then the truth, and leaves
them in a fury. Constance and Norbert fly into each other's arms,
and the tramp of the soldiers who come to arrest them is heard as
the curtain falls.</p>
<p>I do not believe that Browning meant to make self-sacrifice the
root of Constance's doings. If he did, he has made a terrible mess
of the whole thing. He was much too clear-headed a moralist to link
self-sacrifice to systematic lying. Self-sacrifice is not
self-sacrifice at all when it sacrifices truth. It may wear the
clothes of Love, but, in injuring righteousness, it injures the
essence of love. It has a surface beauty, for it imitates love, but
if mankind is allured by this beauty, mankind is injured. It is the
false Florimel of self-sacrifice. Browning, who had studied
self-sacrifice, did not exhibit it in Constance. There is something
else at the root of her actions, and I believe he meant it to be
jealousy. The very first lie she urges her lover to tell (that is,
to let the Queen imagine he loves her) <a name='Page342' id=
"Page342"></a><span class='pagenum'>342</span>is just the thing a
jealous woman would invent to try her lover and the Queen, if she
suspected the Queen of loving him, and him of being seduced from
her by the worldly advantage of marrying the Queen. And all the
other lies are best explained on the supposition of jealous
experiments. At the last she is satisfied; the crowning test had
been tried. Through a sea of lying she had made herself sure of
Norbert's love, and she falls into his arms. Had Browning meant
Constance to be an image of self-sacrifice, he would scarcely have
written that line when Norbert, having told the truth of the matter
to the Queen, looks at both women, and cries out, "You two glare,
each at each, like panthers now." A woman, filled with the joy and
sadness of pure self-sacrifice, would not have felt at this moment
like a panther towards the woman for whom she had sacrificed
herself.</p>
<p>Even as a study of jealousy, Constance is too subtle. Jealousy
has none of these labyrinthine methods; it goes straight with fiery
passion to its end. It may be said, then, that Constance is not a
study of jealousy. But it may be a study by Browning of what he
thought in his intellect jealousy would be. At any rate, Constance,
as a study of self-sacrifice, is a miserable failure. Moreover, it
does not make much matter whether she is a study of this or that,
because she is eminently wrong-natured. Her lying is unendurable,
only to be explained or excused by the madness of jealousy, and
she, though jealous, is not maddened enough by jealousy to excuse
her lies. The situations she causes are almost too ugly. Whenever
the truth is told, either by the Queen or Norbert, the situations
<a name='Page343' id="Page343"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>343</span>break up in disgrace for her. It is difficult
to imagine how Norbert could go on loving her. His love would have
departed if they had come to live together. He is radically true,
and she is radically false. A fatal split would have been
inevitable. Nothing could be better for them both&mdash;after their
momentary outburst of love at the end&mdash;than death.</p>
<p>From the point of view of art, Constance is interesting. It is
more than we can say of Domizia in <i>Luria</i>. She is nothing
more than a passing study whom Browning uses to voice his theories.
Eulalia in <i>A Soul's Tragedy</i> is also a transient thing, only
she is more colourless, more a phantom than Domizia.</p>
<p>By this time, by the year 1846, Browning had found out that he
could not write dramas well, or even such dramatic proverbs as
<i>In a Balcony</i>. And he gave himself up to another species of
his art. The women he now draws (some of which belong to the years
during which he wrote dramas) are done separately, in dramatic
lyrics as he called them, and in narrative and philosophical poems.
Some are touched only at moments of their lives, and we are to
infer from the momentary action and feeling the whole of the woman.
Others are carefully and lovingly drawn from point to point in a
variety of action, passion and circumstance. In these we find
Browning at his best in the drawing of women. I know no women among
the second-rate poets so sweetly, nobly, tenderly and wisely drawn
as Pompilia and Balaustion.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3><i>WOMANHOOD IN BROWNING<br />
(THE DRAMATIC LYRICS AND POMPILIA)</i></h3>
<p>No modern poet has written of women with such variety as
Browning. Coleridge, except in a few love-poems, scarcely touched
them. Wordsworth did not get beyond the womanhood of the home
affections, except in a few lovely and spiritual sketches of
girlhood which are unique in our literature, in which maidenhood
and the soul of nature so interchange their beauty that the girl
seems born of the lonely loveliness of nature and lives with her
mother like a child.</p>
<p>What motherhood in its deep grief and joy, what sisterhood and
wifehood may be, have never been sung with more penetration and
exquisiteness than Wordsworth sang them. But of the immense range,
beyond, of womanhood he could not sing. Byron's women are mostly in
love with Byron under various names, and he rarely strays beyond
the woman who is loved or in love. The woman who is most vital,
true and tender is Haid&eacute;e in <i>Don Juan</i>. Shelley's
women melt into philosophic mist, or are used to build up a
political or social theory, as if they were "properties" of
literature. Cythna, Rosalind, Asia, Emilia are ideas, not <a name=
'Page345' id="Page345"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>345</span>realities. Beatrice is alive, but she was drawn
for him in the records of her trial. Even the woman of his later
lyrics soon ceases to be flesh and blood. Keats let women alone,
save in Isabella, and all that is of womanhood in her is derived
from Boccaccio. Madeline is nothing but a picture. It is curious
that his remarkable want of interest in the time in which he lived
should be combined with as great a want of interest in women, as if
the vivid life of any period in the history of a people were bound
up with the vivid life of women in that period. When women awake no
full emotion in a poet, the life of the time, as in the case of
Keats, awakes little emotion in him. He will fly to the past for
his subjects. Moreover, it is perhaps worth saying that when the
poets cease to write well about women, the phase of poetry they
represent, however beautiful it be, is beginning to decay. When
poetry is born into a new life, women are as living in it as men.
Womanhood became at once one of its dominant subjects in Tennyson
and Browning. Among the new political, social, religious,
philosophic and artistic ideas which were then borne like torches
through England, the idea of the free development of women was also
born; and it carried with it a strong emotion. They claimed the
acknowledgment of their separate individuality, of their distinct
use and power in the progress of the world. This was embodied with
extraordinary fulness in <i>Aurora Leigh</i>, and its emotion drove
itself into the work of Tennyson and Browning. How Tennyson treated
the subject in the <i>Princess</i> is well known. His
representation of women in his other poems does not pass beyond
<a name='Page346' id="Page346"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>346</span>a few simple, well-known types both of good and
bad women. But the particular types into which the variety of
womanhood continually throws itself, the quick individualities, the
fantastic simplicities and subtleties, the resolute extremes, the
unconsidered impulses, the obstinate good and evil, the bold
cruelties and the bold self-sacrifices, the fears and audacities,
the hidden work of the thoughts and passions of women in the
far-off worlds within them where their soul claims and possesses
its own desires&mdash;these were beyond the power of Tennyson to
describe, even, I think, to conceive. But they were in the power of
Browning, and he made them, at least in lyric poetry, a chief part
of his work.</p>
<p>In women he touched great variety and great individuality; two
things each of which includes the other, and both of which were
dear to his imagination. With his longing for variety of
representation, he was not content to pile womanhood up into a few
classes, or to dwell on her universal qualities. He took each woman
separately, marking out the points which differentiated her from,
not those which she shared with, the rest of her sex. He felt that
if he dwelt only on the deep-seated roots of the tree of womanhood,
he would miss the endless play, fancy, movement, interaction and
variety of its branches, foliage and flowers. Therefore, in his
lyrical work, he leaves out for the most part the simpler elements
of womanhood and draws the complex, the particular, the impulsive
and the momentary. Each of his women is distinct from the rest.
That is a great comfort in a world which, through laziness, wishes
to busy itself with classes rather than with personalities. I do
not <a name='Page347' id="Page347"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>347</span>believe that Browning ever met man or woman
without saying to himself&mdash;Here is a new world; it may be
classed, but it also stands alone. What distinguishes it from the
rest&mdash;that I will know and that describe.</p>
<p>When women are not enslaved to conventions&mdash;and the new
movement towards their freedom of development which began shortly
after 1840 had enfranchised and has continued ever since to
enfranchise a great number from this slavery&mdash;they are more
individual and various than men are allowed to be. They carry their
personal desires, aspirations and impulses into act, speech, and
into extremes with much greater licence than is possible to men.
One touches with them much more easily the original stuff of
humanity. It was this original, individual and various Thing in
women on which Browning seized with delight. He did not write half
as much as other poets had done of woman as being loved by man or
as loving him. I have said that the mere love-poem is no main
element in his work. He wrote of the original stuff of womanhood,
of its good and bad alike, sometimes of it as all good, as in
Pompilia; but for the most part as mingled of good and ill, and of
the good as destined to conquer the ill.</p>
<p>He did not exalt her above man. He thought her as vital,
interesting and important for progress as man, but not more
interesting, vital, or important. He neither lowered her nor
idealised her beyond natural humanity. She stands in his poetry
side by side with man on an equality of value to the present and
future of mankind. And he has wrought this out not by elaborate
statement of <a name='Page348' id="Page348"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>348</span>it in a theory, as Tennyson did in the
<i>Princess</i> with a conscious patronage of womanhood, but by
unconscious representation of it in the multitude of women whom he
invented.</p>
<p>But though the wholes were equal, the particulars of which the
wholes were composed differed in their values; and women in his
view were more keenly alive than men, at least more various in
their manifestation of life. It was their intensity of life which
most attracted him. He loved nothing so much as life&mdash;in plant
or animal or man. His longer poems are records of the larger
movement of human life, the steadfast record in quiet verse as in
<i>Paracelsus</i>, or the clashing together in abrupt verse as in
<i>Sordello</i>, of the turmoil and meditation, the trouble and joy
of the living soul of humanity. When he, this archangel of reality,
got into touch with pure fact of the human soul, beating with life,
he was enchanted. And this was his vast happiness in his longest
poem, the <i>Ring and the Book</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Do you see this square old yellow book I toss</p>
<p>I' the air, and catch again, and twirl about</p>
<p>By the crumpled vellum covers&mdash;pure crude fact</p>
<p>Secreted from man's life when hearts beat hard</p>
<p>And brains, high blooded, ticked two centuries hence?</p>
<p>Give it me back. The thing's restorative</p>
<p>I' the touch and sight.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But in his lyrics, it was not the steady development of life on
which he loved to write, but the unexpected, original movement of
life under the push of quick thought and sudden passion into some
new form of action which broke through the commonplace of
existence. Men and women, and chiefly women, when they spoke and
acted on a keen edge of life <a name='Page349' id=
"Page349"></a><span class='pagenum'>349</span>with a precipice
below them or on the summit of the moment, with straight and clear
intensity, and out of the original stuff of their nature&mdash;were
his darling lyric subjects. And he did this work in lyrics, because
the lyric is the poem of the moment.</p>
<p>There was one of these critical moments which attracted him
greatly&mdash;that in which all after-life is contained and
decided; when a step to the right or left settles, in an instant,
the spiritual basis of the soul. I have already mentioned some of
these poems&mdash;those concerned with love, such as <i>By the
Fireside</i> or <i>Cristina</i>&mdash;and the woman is more
prominent in them than the man. One of the best of them, so far as
the drawing of a woman is concerned, is <i>Dis aliter visum</i>. We
see the innocent girl, and ten years after what the world has made
of her. But the heart of the girl lies beneath the woman of the
world. And she recalls to the man the hour when they lingered near
the church on the cliff; when he loved her, when he might have
claimed her, and did not. He feared they might repent of it;
sacrificing to the present their chance of the eternities of love.
"Fool! who ruined four lives&mdash;mine and your opera-dancer's,
your own and my husband's!" Whether her outburst now be quite true
to her whole self or not Browning does not let us know; but it is
true to that moment of her, and it is full of the poetry of the
moment she recalls. Moreover, these thirty short verses paint as no
other man could have done the secret soul of a woman in society. I
quote her outburst. It is full of Browning's keen poetry; and the
first verse of it may well be compared with a similar moment in
<i>By the Fireside</i>, <a name='Page350' id=
"Page350"></a><span class='pagenum'>350</span>where nature is made
to play the same part, but succeeds as here she fails:</p>

<p class='i2'>Vilely; her vogue has had its day.</p>
<p>Here comes my husband from his whist.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Here the woman speaks for herself. It is characteristic of
Browning's boldness that there are a whole set of poems in which he
imagines the unexpressed thoughts which a woman revolves in
self-communion under the questionings and troubles of the passions,
and chiefly of the passion of love. The most elaborate of these is
<i>James Lee's Wife</i>, which tells what she thinks of when after
long years she has been unable to retain her husband's love.
Finally, she leaves him. The analysis of her thinking is
interesting, but the woman is not. She is not the quick, natural
woman Browning was able to paint so well when he chose. His own
analytic excitement, which increases in mere intellectuality as the
poem moves on, enters into her, and she thinks more through
Browning the man than through her womanhood. Women are complex
enough, more complex than men, but they are not complex in the
fashion of this poem. Under the circumstances Browning has made,
her thought would have been quite clear at its root, and indeed in
its branches. She is represented as in love with her husband. Were
she really in love, she would not have been so involved, or able to
argue out her life so anxiously. Love or love's sorrow knows itself
at once and altogether, and its cause and aim are simple. But
Browning has unconsciously made the woman clear enough for us to
guess the real cause of her departure. That <a name='Page352' id=
"Page352"></a><span class='pagenum'>352</span>departure is believed
by some to be a self-sacrifice. There are folk who see
self-sacrifice in everything Browning wrote about women. Browning
may have originally intended her action to be one of
self-sacrifice, but the thing, as he went on, was taken out of his
hands, and turns out to be quite a different matter. The woman
really leaves her husband because her love for him was tired out.
She talks of leaving her husband free, and perhaps, in women's way,
persuades herself that she is sacrificing herself; but she desires
in reality to set herself free from an unavailing struggle to keep
his love. There comes a time when the striving for love wearies out
love itself. And James Lee's wife had reached that moment. Her
departure, thus explained, is the most womanly thing in the poem,
and I should not wonder if Browning meant it so. He knew what
self-sacrifice really was, and this departure of the woman was not
a true self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Another of these poems in which a woman speaks out her heart is
<i>Any Wife to any Husband</i>. She is dying, and she would fain
claim his undying fidelity to his love of her; but though she
believes in his love, she thinks, when her presence is not with
him, that his nature will be drawn towards other women. Then what
he brings her, when he meets her again, will not be perfect.
Womanly to the core, and her nature is a beautiful nature, she says
nothing which is not kind and true, and the picture she draws of
faithfulness, without one stain of wavering, is natural and lovely.
But, for all that, it is jealousy that speaks, the desire to claim
all for one's self. "Thou art mine, <a name='Page353' id=
"Page353"></a><span class='pagenum'>353</span>and mine
only"&mdash;that fine selfishness which injures love so deeply in
the end, because it forbids its expansion, that is, forbids the
essential nature of love to act. That may be pardoned, unless in
its extremes, during life, if the pardon does not increase it; but
this is in the hour of death, and it is unworthy of the higher
world. To carry jealousy beyond the grave is a phase of that
selfish passion over which this hour, touched by the larger thought
of the infinite world, should have uplifted the woman. Still, what
she says is in nature, and Browning's imagination has closed
passionately round his subject. But he has left us with pity for
the woman rather than with admiration of her.</p>
<p>Perhaps the subtlest part of the poem is the impression left on
us that the woman knows all her pleading will be in vain, that she
has fathomed the weakness of her husband's character. He will not
like to remember that knowledge of hers; and her letting him feel
it is a kind of vengeance which will not help him to be faithful.
It is also her worst bitterness, but if her womanhood were perfect,
she would not have had that bitterness.</p>
<p>In these two poems, and in others, there is to be detected the
deep-seated and quiet half-contempt&mdash;contempt which does not
damage love, contempt which is half pity&mdash;which a woman who
loves a man has for his weakness under passion or weariness. Both
the wives in these poems feel that their husbands are inferior to
themselves in strength of character and of intellect. To feel this
is common enough in women, but is rarely confessed by them. A man
scarcely ever finds it out from his own observation; he is too vain
for that. But <a name='Page354' id="Page354"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>354</span>Browning knew it. A poet sees many things, and
perhaps his wife told him this secret. It was like his audacity to
express it.</p>
<p>This increased knowledge of womanhood was probably due to the
fact that Browning possessed in his wife a woman of genius who had
studied her own sex in herself and in other women. It is owing to
her, I think, that in so many poems the women are represented as of
a finer, even a stronger intellect than the men. Many poets have
given them a finer intuition; that is a common representation. But
greater intellectual power allotted to women is only to be found in
Browning. The instances of it are few, but they are remarkable.</p>
<p>It was owing also to his wife, whose relation to him was frank
on all points, that Browning saw so much more clearly than other
poets into the deep, curious or remote phases of the passions,
thoughts and vagaries of womanhood. I sometimes wonder what women
themselves think of the things Browning, speaking through their
mouth, makes them say; but that is a revelation of which I have no
hope, and for which, indeed, I have no desire.</p>
<p>Moreover, he moved a great deal in the society where women, not
having any real work to do, or if they have it, not doing it,
permit a greater freedom to their thoughts and impulses than those
of their sex who sit at the loom of duty. Tennyson withdrew from
this society, and his women are those of a retired poet&mdash;a few
real types tenderly and sincerely drawn, and a few more worked out
by thinking about what he imagined they would be, not by knowing
them. Browning, roving through his class and other classes of
society, and observ<a name='Page355' id="Page355"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>355</span>ing while he seemed unobservant, drew into his
inner self the lives of a number of women, saw them living and
feeling in a great diversity of circumstances; and, always on the
watch, seized the moment into which he thought the woman entered
with the greatest intensity, and smote that into a poem. Such
poems, naturally lyrics, came into his head at the opera, at a
ball, at a supper after the theatre, while he talked at dinner,
when he walked in the park; and they record, not the whole of a
woman's character, but the vision of one part of her nature which
flashed before him and vanished in an instant. Among these poems
are <i>A Light Woman, A Pretty Woman, Solomon and Balkis, Gold
Hair</i>, and, as a fine instance of this sheet-lightning poem
about women&mdash;<i>Adam, Lilith and Eve. Too Late</i> and <i>The
Worst of It</i> do not belong to these slighter poems; they are on
a much higher level. But they are poems of society and its secret
lives. The men are foremost in them, but in each of them a
different woman is sketched, through the love of the men, with a
masterly decision.</p>
<p>Among all these women he did not hesitate to paint the types
farthest removed from goodness and love. The lowest woman in the
poems is she who is described in <i>Time's Revenges</i>&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>So is my spirit, as flesh with sin,</p>
<p>Filled full, eaten out and in</p>
<p>With the face of her, the eyes of her,</p>
<p>The lips, the little chin, the stir</p>
<p>Of shadow round her mouth; and she</p>
<p>&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;calmly would decree</p>
<p>That I should roast at a slow fire,</p>
<p>If that would compass her desire</p>
<p>And make her one whom they invite</p>
<p>To the famous ball to-morrow night</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page356' id="Page356"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>356</span>Contrasted with this woman, from whose brutal
nature civilisation has stripped away the honour and passion of the
savage, the woman of <i>In a Laboratory</i> shines like a fallen
angel. She at least is natural, and though the passions she feels
are the worst, yet she is capable of feeling strongly. Neither have
any conscience, but we can conceive that one of these women might
attain it, but the other not. Both are examples of a thing I have
said is exceedingly rare in Browning's poetry&mdash;men or women
left without some pity of his own touched into their circumstances
or character.</p>
<p><i>In a Laboratory</i> is a full-coloured sketch of what
womanhood could become in a court like that of Francis I.; in which
every shred of decency, gentlehood and honour had disappeared.
Browning's description, vivid as it is, is less than the reality.
Had he deepened the colours of iniquity and indecency instead of
introducing so much detailed description of the laboratory, detail
which weakens a little our impression of the woman, he had done
better, but all the same there is no poet in England, living or
dead, who could have done it so well. One of the best things in the
poem is the impression made on us that it is not jealousy, but the
hatred of envy which is the motive of the woman. Jealousy supposes
love or the image of love, but among those who surrounded Francis,
love did not exist at all, only lust, luxury and greed of power;
and in the absence of love and in the scorn of it, hate and envy
reign unchallenged. This is what Browning has realised in this
poem, and, in this differentiation, he has given us not only
historical but moral truth.</p>
<p><a name='Page357' id="Page357"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>357</span>Apart from these lighter and momentary poems
about women there are those written out of his own ideal of
womanhood, built up not only from all he knew and loved in his
wife, but also out of the dreams of his heart. They are the
imaginings of the high honour and affection which a man feels for
noble, natural and honest womanhood. They are touched here and
there by complex thinking, but for the most part are of a beloved
simplicity and tenderness, and they will always be beautiful. There
is the sketch of the woman in <i>The Italian in England</i>, a
never to be forgotten thing. It is no wonder the exile remembered
her till he died. There is the image we form of the woman in <i>The
Flowers Name</i>. He does not describe her; she is far away, but
her imagined character and presence fill the garden with an incense
sweeter than all the flowers, and her beauty irradiates all beauty,
so delicately and so plenteously does the lover's passion make her
visible. There is <i>Evelyn Hope</i>, and surely no high and pure
love ever created a more beautiful soul in a woman than hers who
waits her lover in the spiritual world. There are those on whom we
have already dwelt&mdash;Pippa, Colombe, Mildred, Guendolen. There
is the woman in the <i>Flight of the Duchess</i>; not a sketch, but
a completed picture. We see her, just emerged from her convent,
thrilling with eagerness to see the world, believing in its beauty,
interested in everything, in the movement of the leaves on the
trees, of the birds in the heaven, ready to speak to every one high
or low, desirous to get at the soul of all things in Nature and
Humanity, herself almost a creature of the element, akin to air and
fire.</p>
<p><a name='Page358' id="Page358"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>358</span>She is beaten into silence, but not crushed;
overwhelmed by dry old people, by imitation of dead things, but the
life in her is not slain. When the wandering gipsy claims her for a
natural life, her whole nature blossoms into beauty and joy. She
will have troubles great and deep, but every hour will make her
conscious of more and more of life. And when she dies, it will be
the beginning of an intenser life.</p>
<p>Finally, there is his wife. She is painted in these lyric poems
with a simplicity of tenderness, with a reticence of worship as
sacred as it is fair and delicate, with so intense a mingling of
the ideal and the real that we never separate them, and with so
much passion in remembrance of the past and in longing for the
future, that no comment can enhance the picture Browning draws of
her charm, her intellect and her spirit.</p>
<p>These pictures of womanhood were set forth before 1868, when a
collected edition of his poems was published in six volumes. They
were chiefly short, even impressionist studies, save those in the
dramas, and Palma in <i>Sordello</i>. Those in the dramas were
troubled by his want of power to shape them in that vehicle. It
would have then been a pity if, in his matured strength, he had not
drawn into clear existence, with full and careful, not
impressionist work, and with unity of conception, some women who
should, standing alone, become permanent personages in poetry; whom
men and women in the future, needing friends, should love, honour
and obey, and in whom, when help and sympathy and wisdom were
wanted, these healing powers should be found. Browning did this for
us <a name='Page359' id="Page359"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>359</span>in <i>Pompilia</i> and <i>Balaustion</i>, an
Italian and a Greek girl&mdash;not an English girl. It is strange
how to the very end he lived as a poet outside of his own land.</p>
<p>In 1868, Pompilia appeared before the world, and she has
captured ever since the imagination, the conscience and the
sentiment of all who love womanhood and poetry. Her character has
ennobled and healed mankind. Born of a harlot, she is a star of
purity; brought up by characters who love her, but who do not rise
above the ordinary meanness and small commercial honesty of their
class, she is always noble, generous, careless of wealth, and of a
high sense of honour. It is as if Browning disdained for the time
all the philosophy of heredity and environment; and indeed it was
characteristic of him to believe in the sudden creation of beauty,
purity and nobility out of their contraries and in spite of them.
The miracle of the unrelated birth of genius&mdash;that out of the
dunghill might spring the lily, and out of the stratum of crime the
saint&mdash;was an article of faith with him. Nature's or God's
surprises were dear to him; and nothing purer, tenderer, sweeter,
more natural, womanly and saintly was ever made than Pompilia, the
daughter of a vagrant impurity, the child of crime, the girl who
grew to womanhood in mean and vulgar circumstances.</p>
<p>The only hatred she earns is the hatred of Count Guido her
husband, the devil who has tortured and murdered her&mdash;the
hatred of evil for good. When Count Guido, condemned to death,
bursts into the unrestrained expression of his own nature, he
cannot say one word about Pompilia which is not set <a name=
'Page360' id="Page360"></a><span class='pagenum'>360</span>on fire
by a hell of hatred. Nothing in Browning's writing is more vivid,
more intense, than these sudden outbursts of tiger fierceness
against his wife. They lift and enhance the image of Pompilia.</p>
<p>When she comes into contact with other characters such as the
Archbishop and the Governor, men overlaid with long-deposited
crusts of convention, she wins a vague pity from them, but her
simplicity, naturalness and saintliness are nearly as repugnant to
social convention as her goodness is to villany; and Browning has,
all through the poem, individualised in Pompilia the natural
simplicity of goodness in opposition to the artificial moralities
of conservative society. But when Pompilia touches characters who
have any good, however hidden, in them, she draws forth that good.
Her so-called parents pass before they die out of meanness into
nobility of temper. Conti, her husband's cousin, a fat, waggish man
of the world, changes into seriousness, pity and affection under
her silent influence. The careless folk she meets on her flight to
Rome recognise, even in most suspicious circumstances, her
innocence and nobleness; and change at a touch their ordinary
nature for a higher. And when she meets a fine character like
Caponsacchi, who has been led into a worldly, immoral and
indifferent life, he is swept in a moment out of it by the sight
alone of this star of innocence and spiritual beauty, and becomes
her true mate, daily self-excelled. The monk who receives her dying
confession, the Pope, far set by his age above the noise of popular
Rome, almost at one with the world beyond death and feeling what
the divine judgment would be, both recognise with a fervour
<a name='Page361' id="Page361"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>361</span>which carries them beyond the prejudices of age
and of their society the loveliness of Heaven in the spirit of this
girl of seventeen years, and claim her as higher than
themselves.</p>
<p>It is fitting that to so enskied and saintly a child, when she
rests before her death, the cruel life she had led for four years
should seem a dream; and the working out of that thought, and of
the two checks of reality it received in the coming of her child
and the coming of Caponsacchi, is one of the fairest and most
delicate pieces of work that Browning ever accomplished. She was so
innocent and so simple-hearted&mdash;and the development of that
part of her character in the stories told of her childhood is
exquisitely touched into life&mdash;so loving, so born to be happy
in being loved, that when she was forced into a maze of villany,
bound up with hatred, cruelty, baseness and guilt, she seemed to
live in a mist of unreality. When the pain became too deep to be
dreamlike she was mercifully led back into the dream by the
approach of death. As she lay dying there, all she had suffered
passed again into unreality. Nothing remained but love and purity,
the thrill when first she felt her child, the prayer to God which
brought Caponsacchi to her rescue so that her child might be born,
and lastly the vision of perfect union hereafter with her kindred
soul, who, not her lover on earth, would be her lover in eternity.
Even her boy, who had brought her, while she lived, her keenest
sense of reality (and Browning's whole treatment of her motherhood,
from the moment she knew she was in child, till the hour when the
boy lay in her arms, is as true and tender as if his wife had
filled his soul while he <a name='Page362' id=
"Page362"></a><span class='pagenum'>362</span>wrote), even her boy
fades away into the dream. It is true she was dying, and there is
no dream so deep as dying. Yet it was bold of Browning, and
profoundly imagined by him, to make the child disappear, and to
leave the woman at last alone with the thought and the spiritual
passion of her union with Caponsacchi&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>O lover of my life, O soldier saint,</p>
<p>No work begun shall ever pause for death.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>It is the love of Percival's sister for Galahad.</p>
<p>It is not that she is naturally a dreamer, that she would not
have felt and enjoyed the realities of earth. Her perceptions are
keen, her nature expansive. Browning, otherwise, would not have
cared for her. It was only when she was involved in evil, like an
angel in hell (a wolfs arm round her throat and a snake curled over
her feet), that she seemed to be dreaming, not living. It was
incredible to her that such things should be reality. Yet even the
dream called the hidden powers of her soul into action. In
realising these as against evil she is not the dreamer. Her
fortitude is unbroken; her moral courage never fails, though she is
familiar with fear; her action, when the babe has leaped in her
womb, is prompt, decisive and immediate; her physical courage, when
her husband overtakes her and befouls her honour, is like a man's.
She seizes his sword and would have slain the villain. Then, her
natural goodness, the genius of her goodness, gives her a spiritual
penetration which is more than an equivalent in her for an educated
intelligence. Her intuition is so keen that she sees through the
false worldliness of Caponsacchi to the <a name='Page363' id=
"Page363"></a><span class='pagenum'>363</span>real man beneath, and
her few words call it into goodness and honour for ever. Her clear
sense of truth sees all the threads of the net of villany in which
she has been caught, and the only means to break through it, to
reveal and bring it into condemnation. Fortitude, courage,
intuition and intelligence are all made to arise out of her natural
saintliness and love. She is always the immortal child.</p>
<p>For a time she has passed on earth through the realms of pain;
and now, stabbed to her death, she looks back on the passage, and
on all who have been kind and unkind to her&mdash;on the whole of
the falsehood and villany. And the royal love in her nature is the
master of the moment. She makes excuses for Violante's lie. "She
meant well, and she did, as I feel now, little harm." "I am right
now, quite happy; dying has purified me of the evil which touched
me, and I colour ugly things with my own peace and joy. Every one
that leaves life sees all things softened and bettered." As to her
husband, she finds that she has little to forgive him at the last.
Step by step she goes over all he did, and even finds excuses for
him, and, at the end, this is how she speaks, a noble utterance of
serene love, lofty intelligence, of spiritual power and of the
forgiveness of eternity.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>For that most woeful man my husband once,</p>
<p>Who, needing respite, still draws vital breath,</p>
<p>I&mdash;pardon him? So far as lies in me,</p>
<p>I give him for his good the life he takes,</p>
<p>Praying the world will therefore acquiesce.</p>
<p>Let him make God amends,&mdash;none, none to me</p>
<p>Who thank him rather that, whereas strange fate</p>
<p>Mockingly styled him husband and me wife,</p>
<p>Himself this way at least pronounced divorce,</p>
<p>Blotted the marriage bond: this blood of mine</p>
<a name='Page364' id="Page364"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>364</p>
<p>Flies forth exultingly at any door,</p>
<p>Washes the parchment white, and thanks the blow</p>
<p>We shall not meet in this world nor the next,</p>
<p>But where will God be absent? In His face</p>
<p>Is light, but in His shadow healing too:</p>
<p>Let Guido touch the shadow and be healed!</p>
<p>And as my presence was importunate,&mdash;</p>
<p>My earthly good, temptation and a snare,&mdash;</p>
<p>Nothing about me but drew somehow down</p>
<p>His hate upon me,&mdash;somewhat so excused</p>
<p>Therefore, since hate was thus the truth of him,&mdash;</p>
<p>May my evanishment for evermore</p>
<p>Help further to relieve the heart that cast</p>
<p>Such object of its natural loathing forth!</p>
<p>So he was made; he nowise made himself:</p>
<p>I could not love him, but his mother did.</p>
<p>His soul has never lain beside my soul:</p>
<p>But for the unresisting body,&mdash;thanks!</p>
<p>He burned that garment spotted by the flesh.</p>
<p>Whatever he touched is rightly ruined: plague</p>
<p>It caught, and disinfection it had craved</p>
<p>Still but for Guido; I am saved through him</p>
<p>So as by fire; to him&mdash;thanks and farewell!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Thus, pure at heart and sound of head, a natural, true woman in
her childhood, in her girlhood, and when she is tried in the
fire&mdash;by nature gay, yet steady in suffering; brave in a hell
of fears and shame; clear-sighted in entanglements of villany;
resolute in self-rescue; seeing and claiming the right help and
directing it rightly; rejoicing in her motherhood and knowing it as
her crown of glory, though the child is from her infamous husband;
happy in her motherhood for one fortnight; slain like a martyr;
loving the true man with immortal love; forgiving all who had
injured her, even her murderer; dying in full faith and love of
God, though her life had been a crucifixion; Pompilia passes away,
and England's men and women will be always grateful to Browning for
her creation.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XV' id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3><i>BALAUSTION</i></h3>
<p>Among the women whom Browning made, Balaustion is the crown. So
vivid is her presentation that she seems with us in our daily life.
And she also fills the historical imagination.</p>
<p>One would easily fall in love with her, like those sensitive
princes in the <i>Arabian Nights</i>, who, hearing only of the
charms of a princess, set forth to find her over the world. Of all
Browning's women, she is the most luminous, the most at unity with
herself. She has the Greek gladness and life, the Greek
intelligence and passion, and the Greek harmony. All that was
common, prattling, coarse, sensual and spluttering in the Greek,
(and we know from Aristophanes how strong these lower elements were
in the Athenian people), never shows a trace of its influence in
Balaustion. Made of the finest clay, exquisite and delicate in
grain, she is yet strong, when the days of trouble come, to meet
them nobly and to change their sorrows into spiritual powers.</p>
<p>And the <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> in which she is placed
exalts her into a heroine, and adds to her the light, colour and
humanity of Greek romance. Born at Rhodes, but of an Athenian
mother, she is <a name='Page366' id="Page366"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>366</span>fourteen when the news arrives that the
Athenian fleet under Nikias, sent to subdue Syracuse, has been
destroyed, and the captive Athenians driven to labour in the
quarries. All Rhodes, then in alliance with Athens, now cries,
"Desert Athens, side with Sparta against Athens." Balaustion alone
resists the traitorous cry. "What, throw off Athens, be disloyal to
the source of art and intelligence&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>to the life and light</p>
<p>Of the whole world worth calling world at all!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And she spoke so well that her kinsfolk and others joined her
and took ship for Athens. Now, a wind drove them off their course,
and behind them came a pirate ship, and in front of them loomed the
land. "Is it Crete?" they thought; "Crete, perhaps, and safety."
But the oars flagged in the hands of the weary men, and the pirate
gained. Then Balaustion, springing to the altar by the mast, white,
rosy, and uplifted, sang on high that song of &AElig;schylus which
saved at Salamis&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>'O sons of Greeks, go, set your country free,</p>
<p>Free your wives, free your children, free the fanes</p>
<p>O' the Gods, your fathers founded,&mdash;sepulchres</p>
<p>They sleep in! Or save all, or all be lost.'</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The crew, impassioned by the girl, answered the song, and drove
the boat on, "churning the black water white," till the land shone
clear, and the wide town and the harbour, and lo, 'twas not Crete,
but Syracuse, luckless fate! Out came a galley from the port. "Who
are you; Sparta's friend or foe?" "Of Rhodes are we, Rhodes that
has forsaken Athens!"</p>
<p>"How, then, that song we heard? All Athens <a name='Page367' id=
"Page367"></a><span class='pagenum'>367</span>was in that
&AElig;schylus. Your boat is full of Athenians&mdash;back to the
pirate; we want no Athenians here.... Yet, stay, that song was
&AElig;schylus; every one knows it&mdash;how about Euripides? Might
you know any of his verses?" For nothing helped the poor Athenians
so much if any of them had his mouth stored with</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Old glory, great plays that had long ago</p>
<p>Made themselves wings to fly about the world,&mdash;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But most of all those were cherished who could recite Euripides
to Syracuse, so mighty was poetry in the ancient days to make
enemies into friends, to build, beyond the wars and jealousies of
the world, a land where all nations are one.</p>
<p>At this the captain cried: "Praise the God, we have here the
very girl who will fill you with Euripides," and the passage brings
Balaustion into full light.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Therefore, at mention of Euripides,</p>
<p>The Captain crowed out, "Euoi, praise the God!</p>
<p>O&ouml;p, boys, bring our owl-shield to the fore!</p>
<p>Out with our Sacred Anchor! Here she stands,</p>
<p>Balaustion! Strangers, greet the lyric girl!</p>
<p>Euripides? Babai! what a word there 'scaped</p>
<p>Your teeth's enclosure, quoth my grandsire's song</p>
<p>Why, fast as snow in Thrace, the voyage through,</p>
<p>Has she been falling thick in flakes of him!</p>
<p>Frequent as figs at Kaunos, Kaunians said.</p>
<p>Balaustion, stand forth and confirm my speech!</p>
<p>Now it was some whole passion of a play;</p>
<p>Now, peradventure, but a honey-drop</p>
<p>That slipt its comb i' the chorus. If there rose</p>
<p>A star, before I could determine steer</p>
<p>Southward or northward&mdash;if a cloud surprised</p>
<p>Heaven, ere I fairly hollaed 'Furl the sail!'&mdash;</p>
<p>She had at fingers' end both cloud and star</p>
<p>Some thought that perched there, tame and tuneable,</p>
<a name='Page368' id="Page368"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>368</p>
<p>Fitted with wings, and still, as off it flew,</p>
<p>'So sang Euripides,' she said, 'so sang</p>
<p>The meteoric poet of air and sea,</p>
<p>Planets and the pale populace of heaven,</p>
<p>The mind of man, and all that's made to soar!'</p>
<p>And so, although she has some other name,</p>
<p>We only call her Wild-pomegranate-flower,</p>
<p>Balaustion; since, where'er the red bloom burns</p>
<p>I' the dull dark verdure of the bounteous tree,</p>
<p>Dethroning, in the Rosy Isle, the rose,</p>
<p>You shall find food, drink, odour, all at once;</p>
<p>Cool leaves to bind about an aching brow.</p>
<p>And, never much away, the nightingale.</p>
<p>Sing them a strophe, with the turn-again,</p>
<p>Down to the verse that ends all, proverb like.</p>
<p>And save us, thou Balaustion, bless the name"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And she answered: "I will recite the last play he wrote from
first to last&mdash;<i>Alkestis</i>&mdash;his strangest, saddest,
sweetest song."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Then because Greeks are Greeks, and hearts are hearts.</p>
<p>And poetry is power,&mdash;they all outbroke</p>
<p>In a great joyous laughter with much love:</p>
<p>"Thank Herakles for the good holiday!</p>
<p>Make for the harbour! Row, and let voice ring,</p>
<p class='i2'>'In we row, bringing more Euripides!'"</p>
<p>All the crowd, as they lined the harbour now,</p>
<p class='i2'>"More of Euripides!"&mdash;took up the cry.</p>
<p>We landed; the whole city, soon astir,</p>
<p>Came rushing out of gates in common joy</p>
<p>To the suburb temple; there they stationed me</p>
<p>O' the topmost step; and plain I told the play,</p>
<p>Just as I saw it; what the actors said,</p>
<p>And what I saw, or thought I saw the while,</p>
<p>At our Kameiros theatre, clean scooped</p>
<p>Out of a hill side, with the sky above</p>
<p>And sea before our seats in marble row:</p>
<p>Told it, and, two days more, repeated it</p>
<p>Until they sent us on our way again</p>
<p>With good words and great wishes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So, we see Balaustion's slight figure under the <a name=
'Page369' id="Page369"></a><span class='pagenum'>369</span>blue
sky, and the white temple of Herakles from the steps of which she
spoke; and among the crowd, looking up to her with rapture, the
wise and young Sicilian who took ship with her when she was sent
back to Athens, wooed her, and found answer before they reached
Pir&aelig;us. And there in Athens she and her lover saw Euripides,
and told the Master how his play had redeemed her from captivity.
Then they were married; and one day, with four of her girl friends,
under the grape-vines by the streamlet side, close to the temple,
Baccheion, in the cool afternoon, she tells the tale; interweaving
with the play (herself another chorus) what she thinks, how she
feels concerning its personages and their doings, and in the
comment discloses her character. The woman is built up in this way
for us. The very excuse she makes for her inserted words reveals
one side of her delightful nature&mdash;her love of poetry, her
love of beauty, her seeing eye, her delicate distinction, her
mingled humility and self-knowledge.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Look at Baccheion's beauty opposite,</p>
<p>The temple with the pillars at the porch!</p>
<p>See you not something beside masonry?</p>
<p>What if my words wind in and out the stone</p>
<p>As yonder ivy, the God's parasite?</p>
<p>Though they leap all the way the pillar leads,</p>
<p>Festoon about the marble, foot to frieze,</p>
<p>And serpentiningly enrich the roof,</p>
<p>Toy with some few bees and a bird or two,&mdash;</p>
<p>What then? The column holds the cornice up.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>As the ivy is to the pillar that supports the cornice, so are
her words to the <i>Alkestis</i> on which she comments.</p>
<p>That is her charming way. She also is, like <a name='Page370'
id="Page370"></a><span class='pagenum'>370</span>Pompilia, young.
But no contrast can be greater than that between Pompilia at
seventeen years of age and Balaustion at fifteen. In Greece, as in
Italy, women mature quickly. Balaustion is born with that genius
which has the experience of age in youth and the fire of youth in
age. Pompilia has the genius of pure goodness, but she is
uneducated, her intelligence is untrained, and her character is
only developed when she has suffered. Balaustion, on the contrary,
has all the Greek capacity, a thorough education, and that
education also which came in the air of that time to those of the
Athenian temper. She is born into beauty and the knowledge of it,
into high thinking and keen feeling; and she knows well why she
thought and how she felt. So finely wrought is she by passion and
intelligence alike, with natural genius to make her powers tenfold,
that she sweeps her kinsfolk into agreement with her, subdues the
sailors to her will, enchants the captain, sings the whole crew
into energy, would have, I believe, awed and enthralled the pirate,
conquers the Syracusans, delights the whole city, draws a talent
out of the rich man which she leaves behind her for the prisoners,
is a dear friend of sombre Euripides, lures Aristophanes, the
mocker, into seriousness, mates herself with him in a whole night's
conversation, and wrings praise and honour from the nimblest, the
most cynical, and the most world-wise intellect in Athens.</p>
<p>Thus, over against Pompilia, she is the image of fine culture,
held back from the foolishness and vanity of culture by the
steadying power of genius. Then her judgment is always balanced.
Each thing to her has many sides. She decides moral <a name=
'Page371' id="Page371"></a><span class='pagenum'>371</span>and
intellectual questions and action with justice, but with mercy to
the wrong opinion and the wrong thing, because her intellect is
clear, tolerant and forgiving through intellectual breadth and
power. Pompilia is the image of natural goodness and of its power.
A spotless soul, though she is passed through hell, enables her,
without a trained intellect, with ignorance of all knowledge, and
with as little vanity as Balaustion, to give as clear and firm a
judgment of right and wrong. She is as tolerant, as full of excuses
for the wrong thing, as forgiving, as Balaustion, but it is by the
power of goodness and love in her, not by that of intellect.
Browning never proved his strength more than when he made these
two, in vivid contrast, yet in their depths in harmony; both equal,
though so far apart, in noble womanhood. Both are beyond
convention; both have a touch of impulsive passion, of natural
wildness, of flower-beauty. Both are, in hours of crisis, borne
beyond themselves, and mistress of the hour. Both mould men, for
their good, like wax in their fingers. But Pompilia is the white
rose, touched with faint and innocent colour; and Balaustion is the
wild pomegranate flower, burning in a crimson of love among the
dark green leaves of steady and sure thought, her powers latent
till needed, but when called on and brought to light, flaming with
decision and revelation.</p>
<p>In this book we see her in her youth, her powers as yet
untouched by heavy sorrow. In the next, in <i>Aristophanes'
Apology</i>, we first find her in matured strength, almost
mastering Aristophanes; and afterwards in the depth of grief, as
she flies with her husband over the seas to Rhodes, leaving behind
<a name='Page372' id="Page372"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>372</span>her Athens, the city of her heart, ruined and
enslaved. The deepest passion in her, the patriotism of the soul,
is all but broken-hearted. Yet, she is the life and support of all
who are with her; even a certain gladness breaks forth in her, and
she secures for all posterity the intellectual record of Athenian
life and the images, wrought to vitality, of some of the greater
men of Athens. So we possess her completely. Her life, her soul,
its growth and strength, are laid before us. To follow her through
these two poems is to follow their poetry. Whenever we touch her we
touch imagination. <i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> is illuminated by
Balaustion's eyes. A glimpse here and there of her enables us to
thread our way without too great weariness through a thorny
undergrowth of modern and ancient thought mingled together on the
subject of the Apology.</p>
<p>In <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> she tells her tale, and
recites, as she did at Syracuse, the <i>Alkestis</i> to her four
friends. But she does more; she comments on it, as she did not at
Syracuse. The comments are, of course, Browning's, but he means
them to reveal Balaustion. They are touched throughout with a
woman's thought and feeling, inflamed by the poetic genius with
which Browning has endowed her. Balaustion is his deliberate
picture of genius the great miracle.</p>
<p>The story of the <i>Alkestis</i> begins before the play. Apollo,
in his exile, having served King Admetos as shepherd, conceives a
friendship for the king, helps him to his marriage, and knowing
that he is doomed to die in early life, descends to hell and begs
the Fates to give him longer life. That is a <a name='Page373' id=
"Page373"></a><span class='pagenum'>373</span>motive, holding in it
strange thoughts of life and death and fate, which pleased
Browning, and he treats it separately, and with sardonic humour, in
the Prologue to one of his later volumes. The Fates refuse to
lengthen Admetos' life, unless some one love him well enough to die
for him. They must have their due at the allotted time.</p>
<p>The play opens when that time arrives. We see, in a kind of
Prologue, Apollo leaving the house of Admetos and Death coming to
claim his victim. Admetos has asked his father, mother, relations
and servants to die instead of him. None will do it; but his wife,
Alkestis, does. Admetos accepts her sacrifice. Her dying, her
death, the sorrow of Admetos is described with all the poignant
humanity of Euripides. In the meantime Herakles has come on the
scene, and Admetos, though steeped in grief, conceals&mdash;his
wife's death and welcomes his friend to his house. As Alkestis is
the heroine of self-sacrifice, Admetos is the hero of hospitality.
Herakles feasts, but the indignant bearing of an old servant
attracts his notice, and he finds out the truth. He is shocked, but
resolves to attack Death himself, who is bearing away Alkestis. He
meets and conquers Death and brings back Alkestis alive to her
husband. So the strong man conquers the Fates, whom even Apollo
could not subdue.</p>
<p>This is a fine subject. Every one can see in how many different
ways it may be treated, with what different conceptions, how
variously the characters may be built up, and what different
ethical and emotional situations may be imaginatively treated in
it. Racine himself thought it the finest of the <a name='Page374'
id="Page374"></a><span class='pagenum'>374</span>Greek subjects,
and began a play upon it. But he died before he finished it, and
ordered his manuscript to be destroyed. We may well imagine how the
quiet, stately genius of Racine would have conceived and ordered
it; with the sincere passion, held under restraint by as sincere a
dignity, which characterised his exalted style.</p>
<p>Balaustion treats it with an equal moral force, and also with
that modern moral touch which Racine would have given it; which,
while it removed the subject at certain points from the Greek
morality, would yet have exalted it into a more spiritual world
than even the best of the Greeks conceived. The commentary of
Balaustion is her own treatment of the subject. It professes to
explain Euripides: it is in reality a fresh conception of the
characters and their motives, especially of the character of
Herakles. Her view of the character of Alkestis, especially in her
death, is not, I think, the view which Euripides took. Her
condemnation of Admetos is unmodified by those other sides of the
question which Euripides suggests. The position Balaustion takes up
with regard to self-sacrifice is far more subtle, with its
half-Christian touches, than the Greek simplicity would have
conceived. Finally, she feels so strongly that the subject has not
been adequately conceived that, at the end, she recreates it for
herself. Even at the beginning she rebuilds the Euripidean matter.
When Apollo and Death meet, Balaustion conceives the meeting for
herself. She images the divine Apollo as somewhat daunted, and
images the dread meeting of these two with modern, not Greek
imagination. It is like the meeting, she thinks, of <a name=
'Page375' id="Page375"></a><span class='pagenum'>375</span>a ruined
eagle, caught as he swooped in a gorge, half heedless, yet
terrific, with a lion, the haunter of the gorge, the lord of the
ground, who pauses, ere he try the worst with the frightful,
unfamiliar creature, known in the shadows and silences of the sky
but not known here. It is the first example we have of Balaustion's
imaginative power working for itself. There is another, farther on,
where she stays her recitation to describe Death's rush in on
Alkestis when the dialogue between him and Apollo is
over&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And, in the fire-flash of the appalling sword,</p>
<p>The uprush and the outburst, the onslaught</p>
<p>Of Death's portentous passage through the door,</p>
<p>Apollon stood a pitying moment-space:</p>
<p>I caught one last gold gaze upon the night,</p>
<p>Nearing the world now: and the God was gone,</p>
<p>And mortals left to deal with misery.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>So she speaks, as if she saw more than Euripides, as if to her
the invisible were visible&mdash;as it was. To see the eternal
unseen is the dower of imagination in its loftiest mood.</p>
<p>She is as much at home with the hero of earth, the highest
manhood, as she is with the gods. When Herakles comes on the scene
she cannot say enough about him; and she conceives him apart from
the Herakles of Euripides. She paints in him, and Browning paints
through her, the idea of the full, the perfect man; and it is not
the ideal of the cultivated, of the sensitive folk. It is more also
a woman's than a man's ideal. For, now, suddenly, into the midst of
the sorrow of the house, every one wailing, life full of penury and
inactivity, there leaps the "gay cheer of a great voice," the
<a name='Page376' id="Page376"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>376</span>full presence of the hero, his "weary happy
face, half god, half man, which made the god-part god the more."
His very voice, which smiled at sorrow, and his look, which, saying
sorrow was to be conquered, proclaimed to all the world "My life is
in my hand to give away, to make men glad," seemed to dry up all
misery at its source, for his love of man makes him always joyful.
When Admetos opened the house to him, and did not tell him of his
wife's death, Balaustion comments "The hero, all truth, took him at
his word, and then strode off to feast." He takes, she thought, the
present rest, the physical food and drink as frankly as he took the
mighty labours of his fate. And she rejoices as much in his jovial
warmth, his joy in eating and drinking and singing, and festivity,
as in his heroic soul. They go together, these things, in a
hero.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Making the most o' the minute, that the soul</p>
<p>And body, strained to height a minute since,</p>
<p>Might lie relaxed in joy, this breathing space,</p>
<p>For man's sake more than ever;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He slew the pest of the marish, yesterday; to-day he takes his
fill of food, wine, song and flowers; to-morrow he will slay
another plague of mankind.</p>
<p>So she sings, praising aloud the heroic temper, as mighty in the
natural joys of natural life, in the strength and honour of the
body, as in the saving of the world from pain and evil. But this
pleasure of the senses, though in the great nature, is in it under
rule, and the moment Herakles hears of Alkestis dead, he casts
aside, in "a splendour of resolve," the feast, wine, song, and
garlands, and <a name='Page377' id="Page377"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>377</span>girds himself to fight with Death for her
rescue And Balaustion, looking after him as he goes, cries out the
judgment of her soul on all heroism. It is Browning's judgment
also, one of the deepest things in his heart; a constant motive in
his poetry, a master-thought in his life.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Gladness be with thee, Helper of our world!</p>
<p>I think this is the authentic sign and seal</p>
<p>Of Godship, that it ever waxes glad,</p>
<p>And more glad, until gladness blossoms, bursts</p>
<p>Into a rage to suffer for mankind,</p>
<p>And recommence at sorrow: drops like seed</p>
<p>After the blossom, ultimate of all.</p>
<p>Say, does the seed scorn earth and seek the sun?</p>
<p>Surely it has no other end and aim</p>
<p>Than to drop, once more die into the ground,</p>
<p>Taste cold and darkness and oblivion there:</p>
<p>And thence rise, tree-like grow through pain to joy,</p>
<p>More joy and most joy,&mdash;do man good again.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>That is the truth Browning makes this woman have the insight to
reveal. Gladness of soul, becoming at one with sorrow and death and
rising out of them the conqueror, but always rejoicing, in itself,
in the joy of the universe and of God, is the root-heroic
quality.</p>
<p>Then there is the crux of the play&mdash;Alkestis is to die for
Admetos, and does it. What of the conduct of Admetos? What does
Balaustion, the woman, think of that? She thinks Admetos is a poor
creature for having allowed it. When Alkestis is brought dying on
the stage, and Admetos follows, mourning over her, Balaustion
despises him, and she traces in the speech of Alkestis, which only
relates to her children's fate and takes no notice of her husband's
protestations, that she has judged her husband, that love is gone
in sad contempt, that all <a name='Page378' id=
"Page378"></a><span class='pagenum'>378</span>Admetos has given her
is now paid for, that her death is a business transaction which has
set her free to think no more about him, only of her children. For,
what seems most pertinent for him to say, if he loved, "Take, O
Fates, your promise back, and take my life, not hers," he does not
say. That is not really the thought of Euripides.</p>
<p>Then, and this is subtly but not quite justly wrought into
Euripides by Balaustion, she traces through the play the slow
awakening of the soul of Admetos to the low-hearted thing he had
done. He comes out of the house, having disposed all things
duteously and fittingly round the dead, and Balaustion sees in his
grave quietude that the truth is dawning on him; when suddenly
Pheres, his father, who had refused to die for him, comes to lay
his offering on the bier. This, Balaustion thinks, plucks Admetos
back out of unselfish thought into that lower atmosphere in which
he only sees his own advantage in the death of Alkestis; and in
which he now bitterly reproaches his father because he did not die
to save Alkestis. And the reproach is the more bitter
because&mdash;and this Balaustion, with her subtle morality,
suggests&mdash;an undernote of conscience causes him to see his own
baser self, now prominent in his acceptance of Alkestis' sacrifice,
finished and hardened in the temper of his father&mdash;young
Admetos in old Pheres. He sees with dread and pain what he may
become when old. This hatred of himself in his father is,
Balaustion thinks, the source of his extreme violence with his
father. She, with the Greek sense of what was due to nature, seeks
to excuse this unfitting scene. Euripides has gone too far for her.
She <a name='Page379' id="Page379"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>379</span>thinks that, if Sophocles had to do with the
matter, he would have made the Chorus explain the man.</p>
<p>But the unnatural strife would not have been explained by
Sophocles as Balaustion explains it. That fine ethical twist of
hers&mdash;"that Admetos hates himself in his father," is too
modern for a Greek. It has the casuistical subtlety which the
over-developed conscience of the Christian Church encouraged. It is
intellectual, too, rather than real, metaphysical more than moral,
Browning rather than Sophocles. Nor do I believe that a Rhodian
girl, even with all Athens at the back of her brain, would have
conceived it at all. Then Balaustion makes another comment on the
situation, in which there is more of Browning than of herself.
"Admetos," she says, "has been kept back by the noisy quarrel from
seeing into the truth of his own conduct, as he was on the point of
doing, for 'with the low strife comes the little mind.'" But when
his father is gone, and Alkestis is borne away, then, in the
silence of the house and the awful stillness in his own heart, he
sees the truth. His shame, the whole woe and horror of his failure
in love, break, like a toppling wave, upon him, and the drowned
truth, so long hidden from him by self, rose to the surface, and
appalled him by its dead face. His soul in seeing true, is saved,
yet so las by fire. At this moment Herakles comes in, leading
Alkestis, redeemed from death; and finding, so Balaustion thinks,
her husband restored to his right mind.</p>
<p>But, then, we ask, how Alkestis, having found him fail, will
live with him again, how she, having topped nobility, will endure
the memory of the <a name='Page380' id="Page380"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>380</span>ignoble in him? That would be the interesting
subject, and the explanation Euripides suggests does not satisfy
Balaustion. The dramatic situation is unfinished. Balaustion, with
her fine instinct, feels that, to save the subject, it ought to be
otherwise treated, and she invents a new Admetos, a new Alkestis.
She has heard that Sophocles meant to make a new piece of the same
matter, and her balanced judgment, on which Browning insists so
often, makes her say, "That is well. One thing has many sides; but
still, no good supplants a good, no beauty undoes another; still I
will love the <i>Alkestis</i> which I know. Yet I have so drunk
this poem, so satisfied with it my heart and soul, that I feel as
if I, too, might make a new poem on the same matter."</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p class='i12'>Ah, that brave</p>
<p>Bounty of poets, the one royal race</p>
<p>That ever was, or will be, in this world!</p>
<p>They give no gift that bounds itself and ends</p>
<p>I' the giving and the taking: theirs so breeds</p>
<p>I' the heart and soul o' the taker, so transmutes</p>
<p>The man who only was a man before,</p>
<p>That he grows godlike in his turn, can give&mdash;</p>
<p>He also: share the poet's privilege,</p>
<p>Bring forth new good, new beauty, from the old.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And she gives her conception of the subject, and it further
unfolds her character.</p>
<p>When Apollo served Admetos, the noble nature of the God so
entered into him that all the beast was subdued in the man, and he
became the ideal king, living for the ennoblement of his people.
Yet, while doing this great work, he is to die, still young, and he
breaks out, in a bitter calm, against the fate which takes him from
the work of his life.</p>
<p>"Not so," answers Alkestis, "I knew what was <a name='Page381'
id="Page381"></a><span class='pagenum'>381</span>coming, and though
Apollo urged me not to disturb the course of things, and not to
think that any death prevents the march of good or ends a life, yet
he yielded; and I die for you&mdash;all happiness."</p>
<p>"It shall never be," replies Admetos; "our two lives are one.
But I am the body, thou art the soul; and the body shall go, and
not the soul. I claim death."</p>
<p>"No," answered Alkestis; "the active power to rule and weld the
people into good is in the man. Thou art the acknowledged power.
And as to the power which, thou sayest, I give thee, as to the soul
of me&mdash;take it, I pour it into thee. Look at me." And as he
looks, she dies, and the king is left&mdash;still twofold as
before, with the soul of Alkestis in him&mdash;himself and her. So
is Fate cheated, and Alkestis in Admetos is not dead. A passage
follows of delicate and simple poetry, written by Browning in a
manner in which I would he had oftener written. To read it is to
regret that, being able to do this, he chose rather to write, from
time to time, as if he were hewing his way through tangled
underwood. No lovelier image of Proserpina has been made in poetry,
not even in Tennyson's <i>Demeter</i>, than this&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And even while it lay, i' the look of him,</p>
<p>Dead, the dimmed body, bright Alkestis' soul</p>
<p>Had penetrated through the populace</p>
<p>Of ghosts, was got to Kor&eacute;,&mdash;throned and crowned</p>
<p>The pensive queen o' the twilight, where she dwells</p>
<p>Forever in a muse, but half away</p>
<p>From flowery earth she lost and hankers for,&mdash;</p>
<p>And there demanded to become a ghost</p>
<p>Before the time.</p>
<p class='i12'>Whereat the softened eyes</p>
<p>Of the lost maidenhood that lingered still</p>
<a name='Page382' id="Page382"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>382</p>
<p>Straying among the flowers in Sicily,</p>
<p>Sudden was startled back to Hades' throne</p>
<p>By that demand: broke through humanity</p>
<p>Into the orbed omniscience of a God,</p>
<p>Searched at a glance Alkestis to the soul</p>
<p>And said ...</p>
<p>"Hence, thou deceiver! This is not to die,</p>
<p>If, by the very death which mocks me now,</p>
<p>The life, that's left behind and past my power,</p>
<p>Is formidably doubled ..."</p>
<p>And so, before the embrace relaxed a whit,</p>
<p>The lost eyes opened, still beneath the look;</p>
<p>And lo, Alkestis was alive again,</p>
<p>And of Admetos' rapture who shall speak?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The old conception has more reality. This is in the vague world
of modern psychical imagination. Nevertheless it has its own
beauty, and it enlarges Browning's picture of the character of
Balaustion.</p>
<p>Her character is still further enlarged in <i>Aristophanes'
Apology</i>. That poem, if we desire intellectual exercise,
illuminated by flashings of imagination, is well worth reading, but
to comprehend it fully, one must know a great deal of Athenian life
and of the history of the Comic Drama. It is the defence by
Aristophanes of his idea of the business, the method, and the use
of Comedy. How far what he says is Browning speaking for
Aristophanes, and how far it is Browning speaking for himself, is
hard to tell. And it would please him to leave that purposely
obscure. What is alive and intense in the poem is, first, the
realisation of Athenian life in several scenes, pictured with all
Browning's astonishing force of presentation, as, for instance, the
feast after the play, and the grim entrance of Sophocles, black
from head to foot, among the glittering and drunken revellers, to
announce the death of Euripides.</p>
<p><a name='Page383' id="Page383"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>383</span>Secondly, there is the presentation of
Aristophanes. Browning has created him for us&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>And no ignoble presence! On the bulge</p>
<p>Of the clear baldness,&mdash;all his head one brow,&mdash;</p>
<p>True, the veins swelled, blue network, and there surged</p>
<p>A red from cheek to temple,&mdash;then retired</p>
<p>As if the dark-leaved chaplet damped a flame,&mdash;</p>
<p>Was never nursed by temperance or health.</p>
<p>But huge the eyeballs rolled back native fire,</p>
<p>Imperiously triumphant: nostrils wide</p>
<p>Waited their incense; while the pursed mouth's pout</p>
<p>Aggressive, while the beak supreme above,</p>
<p>While the head, face, nay, pillared throat thrown back,</p>
<p>Beard whitening under like a vinous foam,</p>
<p>There made a glory, of such insolence&mdash;</p>
<p>I thought,&mdash;such domineering deity</p>
<p>Hephaistos might have carved to cut the brine</p>
<p>For his gay brother's prow, imbrue that path</p>
<p>Which, purpling, recognised the conqueror.</p>
<p>Impudent and majestic: drunk, perhaps,</p>
<p>But that's religion; sense too plainly snuffed:</p>
<p>Still, sensuality was grown a rite.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We see the man, the natural man, to the life. But as the poem
goes on, we company with his intellect and soul, with the struggle
of sensualism against his knowledge of a more ideal life; above
all, with one, who indulging the appetites and senses of the
natural man, is yet, at a moment, their master. The coarse chambers
of his nature are laid bare, his sensuous pleasure in the lower
forms of human life, his joy in satirising them, his contempt for
the good or the ideal life if it throw the sensual man away. Then,
we are made to know the power he has to rise above
this&mdash;without losing it&mdash;into the higher imaginative
region where, for the time, he feels the genius of Sophocles,
Euripides, the moral power of Balaus<a name='Page384' id=
"Page384"></a><span class='pagenum'>384</span>tion, and the beauty
of the natural world. Indeed, in that last we find him in his
extant plays. Few of the Greeks could write with greater
exquisiteness of natural beauty than this wild poet who loved the
dunghill. And Browning does not say this, but records in this
<i>Apology</i> how when Aristophanes is touched for an instant by
Balaustion's reading of the <i>Herakles</i>, and seizing the
psalterion sings the song of Thamuris marching to his trial with
the Muses through a golden autumn morning&mdash;it is the glory and
loveliness of nature that he sings. This portraiture of the poet is
scattered through the whole poem. It is too minute, too full of
detail to dwell on here. It has a thousand touches of life and
intimacy. And it is perhaps the finest thing Browning has done in
portraiture of character. But then there was a certain sympathy in
Browning for Aristophanes. The natural man was never altogether put
aside by Browning.</p>
<p>Lastly, there is the fresh presentation of Balaustion, of the
matured and experienced woman whom we have known as a happy girl.
Euthycles and she are married, and one night, as she is sitting
alone, he comes in, bringing the grave news that Euripides is dead,
but had proved at the court of Archelaos of Macedonia his
usefulness as counsellor to King and State, and his power still to
sing&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Clashed thence <i>Alkaion</i>, maddened <i>Pentheus</i>' up;</p>
<p>Then music sighed itself away, one moan</p>
<p>Iphigeneia made by Aulis' strand;</p>
<p>With her and music died Euripides.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And Athens, hearing, ceased to mock and cried "Bury Euripides in
Peiraios, bring his body back." "Ah," said Balaustion, "Death
alters the point of view. <a name='Page385' id=
"Page385"></a><span class='pagenum'>385</span>But our tribute is in
our hearts; and more, his soul will now for ever teach and bless
the world.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Is not that day come? What if you and I</p>
<p>Re-sing the song, inaugurate the fame?</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For, like Herakles, in his own <i>Alkestis</i>, he now strides
away (and this is the true end of the <i>Alkestis</i>) to surmount
all heights of destiny." While she spoke thus, the Chorus of the
Comedy, girls, boys, and men, in drunken revel and led by
Aristophanes, thundered at the door and claimed admittance.
Balaustion is drawn confronting them&mdash;tall and superb, like
Victory's self; her warm golden eyes flashing under her black hair,
"earth flesh with sun fire," statuesque, searching the crowd with
her glance. And one and all dissolve before her silent splendour of
reproof, all save Aristophanes. She bids him welcome. "Glory to the
Poet," she cries. "Light, light, I hail it everywhere; no matter
for the murk, that never should have been such orb's associate."
Aristophanes changes as he sees her; a new man confronts her.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"So!" he smiled, "piercing to my thought at once,</p>
<p>You see myself? Balaustion's fixed regard</p>
<p>Can strip the proper Aristophanes</p>
<p>Of what our sophists, in their jargon, style</p>
<p>His accidents?"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>He confesses her power to meet him in discourse, unfolds his
views and plans to her, and having contrasted himself with
Euripides, bids her use her thrice-refined refinement, her rosy
strength, to match his argument. She claims no equality with him,
the consummate creator; but only, as a woman, the love of all
things lovable with which to meet <a name='Page386' id=
"Page386"></a><span class='pagenum'>386</span>him who has degraded
Comedy. She appeals to the high poet in the man, and finally bids
him honour the deep humanity in Euripides. To prove it, and to win
his accord, she reads the <i>Herakles</i>, the last of
Euripides.</p>
<p>It is this long night of talk which Balaustion dictates to
Euthycles as she is sailing, day after day, from Athens back to
Rhodes. The aspect of sea and sky, as they sail, is kept before us,
for Balaustion uses its changes as illustrations, and the clear
descriptions tell, even more fully than before, how quick this
woman was to observe natural beauty and to correlate it with
humanity. Here is one example. In order to describe a change in the
temper of Aristophanes from wild license to momentary gravity,
Balaustion seizes on a cloud-incident of the
voyage&mdash;Euthycles, she cries,</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>... "o'er the boat side, quick, what change,</p>
<p>Watch&mdash;in the water! But a second since,</p>
<p>It laughed a ripply spread of sun and sea,</p>
<p>Ray fused with wave, to never disunite.</p>
<p>Now, sudden, all the surface hard and black,</p>
<p>Lies a quenched light, dead motion: what the cause?</p>
<p>Look up, and lo, the menace of a cloud</p>
<p>Has solemnised the sparkling, spoiled the sport!</p>
<p>Just so, some overshadow, some new care</p>
<p>Stopped all the mirth and mocking on his face."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Her feeling for nature is as strong us her feeling for man, and
both are woven together.</p>
<p>All her powers have now ripened, and the last touch has been
given to them by her ideal sorrow for Athens, the country of her
soul, where high intelligence and imagination had created worlds.
She leaves it now, ruined and degraded, and the passionate outbreak
of her patriotic sorrow with <a name='Page387' id=
"Page387"></a><span class='pagenum'>387</span>which the poem opens
lifts the character and imagination of Balaustion into spiritual
splendour. Athens, "hearted in her heart," has perished ignobly.
Not so, she thinks, ought this beauty of the world to have died,
its sea-walls razed to the ground to the fluting and singing of
harlots; but in some vast overwhelming of natural energies
&mdash;in the embrace of fire to join the gods; or in a sundering
of the earth, when the Acropolis should have sunken entire and
risen in Hades to console the ghosts with beauty; or in the
multitudinous over-swarming of ocean. This she could have borne,
but, thinking of what has been, of the misery and disgrace, "Oh,"
she cries, "bear me away&mdash;wind, wave and bark!" But Browning
does not leave Balaustion with only this deep emotion in her heart.
He gives her the spiritual passion of genius. She is swept beyond
her sorrow into that invisible world where the soul lives with the
gods, with the pure Ideas of justice, truth and love; where
immortal life awaits the disembodied soul and we shall see
Euripides. In these high thoughts she will outlive her sorrow.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Why should despair be? Since, distinct above</p>
<p>Man's wickedness and folly, flies the wind</p>
<p>And floats the cloud, free transport for our soul</p>
<p>Out of its fleshly durance dim and low,&mdash;</p>
<p>Since disembodied soul anticipates</p>
<p>(Thought-borne as now, in rapturous unrestraint)</p>
<p>Above all crowding, crystal silentness,</p>
<p>Above all noise, a silver solitude:&mdash;</p>
<p>Surely, where thought so bears soul, soul in time</p>
<p>May permanently bide, "assert the wise,"</p>
<p>There live in peace, there work in hope once more&mdash;</p>
<p>O nothing doubt, Philemon! Greed and strife,</p>
<p>Hatred and cark and care, what place have they</p>
<a name='Page388' id="Page388"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>388</p>
<p>In yon blue liberality of heaven?</p>
<p>How the sea helps! How rose-smit earth will rise</p>
<p>Breast-high thence, some bright morning, and be Rhodes!</p>
<p>Heaven, earth and sea, my warrant&mdash;in their name,</p>
<p>Believe&mdash;o'er falsehood, truth is surely sphered,</p>
<p>O'er ugliness beams beauty, o'er this world</p>
<p>Extends that realm where, "as the wise assert,"</p>
<p>Philemon, thou shalt see Euripides</p>
<p>Clearer than mortal sense perceived the man!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We understand that she has drunk deep of Socrates, that her
spiritual sense reached onward to the Platonic Socrates. In this
supersensuous world of thought she is quieted out of the weakness
which made her miserable over the fall of Athens; and in the quiet,
Browning, who will lift his favourite into perfectness, adds to her
spiritual imagination the dignity of that moral judgment which the
intellect of genius gathers from the facts of history. In spite of
her sorrow, she grasps the truth that there was justice in the doom
of Athens. Let justice have its way. Let the folk die who pulled
her glory down. This is her prophetic strain, the strength of the
Hebrew in the Greek.</p>
<p>And then the prophet in the woman passes, and the poet in her
takes the lyre. She sees the splendid sunset. Why should its
extravagance of glory run to waste? Let me build out of it a new
Athens, quarry out the golden clouds and raise the Acropolis, and
the rock-hewn Place of Assembly, whence new orators may thunder
over Greece; and the theatre where &AElig;schylus, Sophocles,
Euripides, godlike still, may contend for the prize. Yet&mdash;and
there is a further change of thought&mdash;yet that may not be. To
build that poetic vision is to slip away from reality, and the true
use of it. The tragedy <a name='Page389' id=
"Page389"></a><span class='pagenum'>389</span>is
there&mdash;irrevocable. Let it sink deep in us till we see Rhodes
shining over the sea. So great, so terrible, so piteous it is,
that, dwelt on in the soul and seen in memory, it will do for us
what the great tragedians made their tragic themes do for their
hearers. It will purify the heart by pity and terror from the
baseness and littleness of life. Our small hatreds, jealousies and
prides, our petty passions will be rebuked, seem nothing in its
mighty sorrow.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>What else in life seems piteous any more</p>
<p>After such pity, or proves terrible</p>
<p>Beside such terror;</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This is the woman&mdash;the finest creature Browning drew, young
and fair and stately, with her dark hair and amber eyes,
lovely&mdash;the wild pomegranate flower of a girl&mdash;as keen,
subtle and true of intellect as she is lovely, able to comment on
and check Euripides, to conceive a new play out of his subject, to
be his dearest friend, to meet on equality Aristophanes; so full of
lyric sympathy, so full of eager impulse that she thrills the
despairing into action, enslaves a city with her eloquence, charms
her girl-friends by the Ilissus, and so sends her spirit into her
husband that, when the Spartans advise the razing of Athens to the
ground he saves the city by those famous lines of Euripides, of
which Milton sang; so at one with natural beauty, with all beauty,
that she makes it live in the souls of men; so clear in judgment
that she sees the right even when it seems lost in the wrong, that
she sees the justice of the gods in the ruin of the city she most
loved; so poetic of temper <a name='Page390' id=
"Page390"></a><span class='pagenum'>390</span>that everything
speaks to her of life, that she acknowledges the poetry which rises
out of the foulness she hates in Aristophanes, that she loves all
humanity, bad or good, and Euripides chiefly because of his
humanity; so spiritual, that she can soar out of her most
overwhelming sorrow into the stormless world where the gods breathe
pure thought and for ever love; and, abiding in its peace, use the
griefs of earth for the ennoblement of the life of men, because in
all her spiritual apartness, however far it bear her from earth,
she never loses her close sympathy with the fortunes of mankind.
Nay, from her lofty station she is the teacher of truth and love
and justice, in splendid prophecy. It is with an impassioned
exaltation, worthy of Sibyl and Pythoness in one, of divine wisdom
both Roman and Greek, that she cries to the companions of her
voyage words which embody her soul and the soul of all the wise and
loving of the earth, when they act for men; bearing their action,
thought and feeling beyond man to God in man&mdash;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3><i>THE RING AND THE BOOK</i></h3>
<p>When Browning published <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, he was
nearly fifty years old. All his powers (except those which create
the lyric) are used therein with mastery; and the ease with which
he writes is not more remarkable than the exultant pleasure which
accompanies the ease. He has, as an artist, a hundred tools in
hand, and he uses them with certainty of execution. The wing of his
invention does not falter through these twelve books, nor droop
below the level at which he began them; and the epilogue is written
with as much vigour as the prologue. The various books demand
various powers. In each book the powers are proportionate to the
subject; but the mental force behind each exercise of power is
equal throughout. He writes as well when he has to make the guilty
soul of Guido speak, as when the innocence of Pompilia tells her
story. The gain-serving lawyers, each distinctly isolated, tell
their worldly thoughts as clearly as Caponsacchi reveals his
redeemed and spiritualised soul. The parasite of an aristocratic
and thoughtless society in <i>Tertium Quid</i> is not more vividly
drawn than the Pope, who has left in his old age the conventions of
society behind him, and <a name='Page392' id=
"Page392"></a><span class='pagenum'>392</span>speaks in his silent
chamber face to face with God. And all the minor
characters&mdash;of whom there are a great number, ranging from
children to old folk, from the peasant to the Cardinal, through
every class of society in Italy&mdash;are drawn, even when they are
slashed out in only three lines, with such force, certainty, colour
and life that we know them better than our friends. The variousness
of the product would seem to exclude an equality of excellence in
drawing and invention. But it does not. It reveals and confirms it.
The poem is a miracle of intellectual power.</p>
<p>This great length, elaborate detail, and the repetition so many
times of the same story, would naturally suggest to an intending
reader that the poem might be wearisome. Browning, suspecting this,
and in mercy to a public who does not care for a work of <i>longue
haleine</i>, published it at first in four volumes, with a month's
interval between each volume. He thought that the story told afresh
by characters widely different would strike new, if each book were
read at intervals of ten days. There were three books in each
volume. And if readers desire to realise fully the intellectual
<i>tour de force</i> contained in telling the same story twelve
times over, and making each telling interesting, they cannot do
better than read the book as Browning wished it to be read. "Give
the poem four months, and let ten days elapse between the reading
of each book," is what he meant us to understand. Moreover, to meet
this possible weariness, Browning, consciously, or probably
unconsciously, since genius does the right thing without asking
why, continually used a trick of his own which, at intervals,
<a name='Page393' id="Page393"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>393</span>stings the reader into wakefulness and
pleasure, and sends him on to the next page refreshed and happy.
After fifty, or it may be a hundred lines of somewhat dry analysis,
a vivid illustration, which concentrates all the matter of the
previous lines, flashes on the reader as a snake might flash across
a traveller's dusty way: or some sudden description of an Italian
scene in the country or in the streets of Rome enlivens the
well-known tale with fresh humanity. Or a new character leaps up
out of the crowd, and calls us to note his ways, his dress, his
voice, his very soul in some revealing speech, and then passes away
from the stage, while we turn, refreshed (and indeed at times we
need refreshment), to the main speaker, the leading character.</p>
<p>But to dwell on the multitude of portraits with which Browning's
keen observation, memory and love of human nature have embellished
<i>The Ring and the Book</i> belongs to another part of this
chapter. At present the question rises: "What place does <i>The
Ring and the Book</i> hold in Browning's development?" It holds a
central place. There was always a struggle in Browning between two
pleasures; pleasure in the exercise of his intellect&mdash;his wit,
in the fullest sense of the word; pleasure in the exercise of his
poetic imagination. Sometimes one of these had the upper hand in
his poems, sometimes the other, and sometimes both happily worked
together. When the exercise of his wit had the upper hand, it
tended to drive out both imagination and passion. Intellectual play
may be without any emotion except its delight in itself. Then its
mere cleverness attracts its user, and gives him an easily
purchased pleasure. When a poet falls a complete <a name='Page394'
id="Page394"></a><span class='pagenum'>394</span>victim to this
pleasure, imagination hides her face from him, passion runs away,
and what he produces resembles, but is not, poetry. And Browning,
who had got perilously near to the absence of poetry in <i>Bishop
Blougram's Apology</i>, succeeded in <i>Mr. Sludge, the Medium</i>,
in losing poetry altogether. In <i>The Ring and the Book</i> there
are whole books, and long passages in its other books in which
poetry almost ceases to exist and is replaced by brilliant
cleverness, keen analysis, vivid description, and a combination of
wit and fancy which is rarely rivalled; but no emotion, no
imagination such as poets use inflames the coldness of these
qualities into the glow of poetry. The indefinable difference which
makes imaginative work into poetry is not there. There is abundance
of invention; but that, though a part of imagination, belongs as
much to the art of prose as to the art of poetry.</p>
<p>Browning could write thus, out of his intellect alone. None of
the greater poets could. Their genius could not work without fusing
into their intellectual work intensity of feeling; and that
combination secured poetic treatment of their subject. It would
have been totally impossible for Milton, Shakespeare, Dante,
Vergil, or even the great mass of second-rate poets, to have
written some of Browning's so-called poetry&mdash;no matter how
they tried. There was that in Browning's nature which enabled him
to exercise his intellectual powers alone, without passion, and so
far he almost ceases to deserve the name of poet. And his pleasure
in doing this grew upon him, and having done it with dazzling power
in part of <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, he was carried away by it
and produced a number of so-called <a name='Page395' id=
"Page395"></a><span class='pagenum'>395</span>poems; terrible
examples of what a poet can come to when he has allowed his
pleasure in clever analysis to tyrannise over him&mdash;<i>Prince
Hohenstiel-Schwangau, The Inn Album, Red Cotton Nightcap
Country</i>, and a number of shorter poems in the volumes which
followed. In these, what Milton meant by passion, simplicity and
sensuousness were banished, and imagination existed only as it
exists in a prose writer.</p>
<p>This condition was slowly arrived at. It had not been fully
reached when he wrote <i>The Ring and the Book</i>. His poetic
powers resisted their enemies for many years, and had the better in
the struggle. If it takes a long time to cast a devil out, it takes
a longer time to depose an angel. And the devil may be utterly
banished, but the angel never. And though the devil of mere wit and
the little devils of analytic exercise&mdash;devils when they usurp
the throne in a poet's soul and enslave imaginative
emotion&mdash;did get the better of Browning, it was only for a
time. Towards the end of his life he recovered, but never as
completely as he had once possessed them, the noble attributes of a
poet. The evils of the struggle clung to him; the poisonous
pleasure he had pursued still affected him; he was again and again
attacked by the old malaria. He was as a brand plucked from the
burning.</p>
<p><i>The Ring and the Book</i> is the central point of this
struggle. It is full of emotion and thought concentrated on the
subject, and commingled by imagination to produce beauty. And
whenever this is the case, as in the books which treat of
Caponsacchi and Pompilia, we are rejoiced by poetry. In their lofty
matter of thought and feeling, in their simplicity <a name=
'Page396' id="Page396"></a><span class='pagenum'>396</span>and
nobleness of spiritual beauty, poetry is dominant. In them also his
intellectual powers, and his imaginative and passionate powers, are
fused into one fire. Nor is the presentation of Guido Franceschini
under two faces less powerful, or that of the Pope, in his
meditative silence. But in these books the poetry is less, and is
mingled, as would naturally indeed be the case, with a searching
analysis, which intrudes too much into their imaginative work.
Over-dissection makes them cold. In fact, in fully a quarter of
this long poem, the analysing understanding, that bustling and
self-conscious person, who plays only on the surface of things and
separates their elements from one another instead of penetrating to
their centre; who is incapable of seeing the whole into which the
various elements have combined&mdash;is too masterful for the
poetry. It is not, then, imaginative, but intellectual pleasure
which, as we read, we gain.</p>
<p>Then again there is throughout a great part of the poem a
dangerous indulgence of his wit; the amusement of remote analogies;
the use of far-fetched illustrations; quips and cranks and wanton
wiles of the reasoning fancy in deviating self-indulgence; and an
allusiveness which sets commentators into note-making
effervescence. All these, and more, which belong to wit, are often
quite ungoverned, allowed to disport themselves as they please.
Such matters delight the unpoetic readers of Browning, and indeed
they are excellent entertainment. But let us call them by their
true name; let us not call them poetry, nor mistake their art for
the art of poetry. Writing them in blank verse does not make them
poetry. In <i>Half-Rome</i>, <a name='Page397' id=
"Page397"></a><span class='pagenum'>397</span>in <i>The Other
Half-Rome</i>, and in <i>Tertium Quid</i>, these elements of
analysis and wit are exhibited in three-fourths of the verse; but
the other fourth&mdash;in description of scenes, in vivid
portraiture, in transient outbursts out of which passion, in
glimpses, breaks&mdash;rises into the realm of poetry. In the
books which sketch the lawyers and their pleadings, there is wit in
its finest brilliancy, analysis in its keenest veracity, but they
are scarcely a poet's work. The whole book is then a mixed book,
extremely mixed. All that was poetical in Browning's previous work
is represented in it, and all the unpoetical elements which had
gradually been winning power in him, and which showed themselves
previously in <i>Bishop Blougram</i> and <i>Mr. Sludge</i>, are
also there in full blast. It was, as I have said, the central
battlefield of two powers in him. And when <i>The Ring and the
Book</i> was finished, the inferior power had for a time the
victory.</p>
<p>To sum up then, there are books in the poem where matter of
passion and matter of thought are imaginatively wrought together.
There are others where psychological thought and metaphysical
reasoning are dominant, but where passionate feeling has also a
high place. There are others where analysis and wit far excel the
elements of imaginative emotion; and there are others where every
kind of imagination is absent, save that which is consistent
throughout and which never fails&mdash;the power of creating men
and women into distinct individualities. That is left, but it is a
power which is not special to a poet. A prose writer may possess it
with the same fulness as a poet. Carlyle had it as remarkably as
Browning, or nearly as remarkably. <a name='Page398' id=
"Page398"></a><span class='pagenum'>398</span>He also had
wit&mdash;a heavier wit than Browning's, less lambent, less
piercing, but as forcible.</p>
<p>One thing more may be said. The poem is far too long, and the
subject does not bear its length. The long poems of the world (I do
not speak of those by inferior poets) have a great subject, are
concerned with manifold fates of men, and are naturally full of
various events and varied scenery. They interest us with new things
from book to book. In <i>The Ring and the Book</i> the subject is
not great, the fates concerned are not important, and the same
event runs through twelve books and is described twelve times.
However we may admire the intellectual force which actually makes
the work interesting, and the passion which often thrills us in
it&mdash;this is more than the subject bears, and than we can
always endure. Each book is spun out far beyond what is necessary;
a great deal is inserted which would be wisely left out. No one
could be more concise than Browning when he pleased. His power of
flashing a situation or a thought into a few words is well known.
But he did not always use this power. And in <i>The Ring and the
Book</i>, as in some of the poems that followed it, he seems now
and then to despise that power.</p>
<p>And now for the poem itself. Browning tells the story eight
times by different persons, each from a different point of view,
and twice more by the same person before and after his condemnation
and, of course, from two points of view. Then he practically tells
it twice more in the prologue and the epilogue&mdash;twelve times
in all&mdash;and in spite of what I have said about the too great
length of the poem, this is an intellectual victory that no one
else but <a name='Page399' id="Page399"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>399</span>Browning could have won against its
difficulties. Whether it was worth the creation by himself of the
difficulty is another question. He chose to do it, and we had
better submit to him and get the good of his work. At least we may
avoid some of the weariness he himself feared by reading it in the
way I have mentioned, as Browning meant it to be read.
Poems&mdash;being the highest product of the highest genius of
which man is capable&mdash;ought to be approached with some
reverence. And a part of that reverence is to read them in
accordance with the intention and desire of the writer.</p>
<p>We ought not to forget the date of the tale when we read the
book. It is just two hundred years ago. The murder of Pompilia took
place in 1698; and the book completes his studies of the
Renaissance in its decay. If <i>Sordello</i> is worth our careful
reading as a study of the thirteenth century in North Italy, this
book is as valuable as a record of the society of its date. It is,
in truth, a mine of gold; pure crude ore is secreted from man's
life, then moulded into figures of living men and women by the
insight and passion of the poet. In it is set down Rome as she
was&mdash;her customs, opinions, classes of society; her dress,
houses, streets, lanes, byeways and squares; her architecture,
fountains, statues, courts of law, convents, gardens; her fashion
and its drawing-rooms, the various professions and their habits,
high life and middle class, tradesmen and beggars, priest, friar,
lay-ecclesiastic, cardinal and Pope. Nowhere is this pictorial and
individualising part of Browning's genius more delighted with its
work. Every description is written by a lover of humanity, and with
joy.</p>
<p><a name='Page400' id="Page400"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>400</span>Nor is he less vivid in the
<i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> in which he places this multitude of
personages. In <i>Half-Rome</i> we mingle with the crowd between
Palazzo Fiano and Ruspoli, and pass into the church of Lorenzo in
Lucina where the murdered bodies are exposed. The mingled humours
of the crowd, the various persons and their characters are combined
with and enhanced by the scenery. Then there is the Market Place by
the Capucin convent of the Piazza Barberini, with the fountains
leaping; then the <i>R&eacute;union</i> at a palace, and the fine
fashionable folk among the mirrors and the chandeliers, each with
their view of the question; then the Courthouse, with all its
paraphernalia, where Guido and Caponsacchi plead; then, the
sketches, as new matters turn up, of the obscure streets of Rome,
of the country round Arezzo, of Arezzo itself, of the post road
from Arezzo to Rome and the country inn near Rome, of the garden
house in the suburbs, of the households of the two advocates and
their different ways of living; of the Pope in his closet and of
Guido in the prison cell; and last, the full description of the
streets and the Piazza del Popolo on the day of the
execution&mdash;all with a hundred vivifying, illuminating, minute
details attached to them by this keen-eyed, observant, questing
poet who remembered everything he saw, and was able to use each
detail where it was most wanted. Memories are good, but good usage
of them is the fine power. The <i>mise-en-sc&egrave;ne</i> is then
excellent, and Browning was always careful to make it right,
fitting and enlivening. Nowhere is this better done than in the
Introduction where he finds the book on a stall in the Square of
San Lorenzo, and describes modern <a name='Page401' id=
"Page401"></a><span class='pagenum'>401</span>Florence in his walk
from the Square past the Strozzi, the Pillar and the Bridge to Casa
Guidi on the other side of the Arno opposite the little church of
San Felice. During the walk he read the book through, yet saw
everything he passed by. The description will show how keen were
his eyes, how masterly his execution.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>That memorable day,</p>
<p>(June was the month, Lorenzo named the Square)</p>
<p>I leaned a little and overlooked my prize</p>
<p>By the low railing round the fountain-source</p>
<p>Close to the statue, where a step descends:</p>
<p>While clinked the cans of copper, as stooped and rose</p>
<p>Thick-ankled girls who brimmed them, and made place</p>
<p>For marketmen glad to pitch basket down,</p>
<p>Dip a broad melon-leaf that holds the wet,</p>
<p>And whisk their faded fresh. And on I read</p>
<p>Presently, though my path grew perilous</p>
<p>Between the outspread straw-work, piles of plait</p>
<p>Soon to be flapping, each o'er two black eyes</p>
<p>And swathe of Tuscan hair, on festas fine:</p>
<p>Through fire-irons, tribes of tongs, shovels in sheaves,</p>
<p>Skeleton bedsteads, wardrobe-drawers agape,</p>
<p>Rows of tall slim brass lamps with dangling gear,&mdash;</p>
<p>And worse, cast clothes a-sweetening in the sun:</p>
<p>None of them took my eye from off my prize.</p>
<p>Still read I on, from written title page</p>
<p>To written index, on, through street and street,</p>
<p>At the Strozzi, at the Pillar, at the Bridge;</p>
<p>Till, by the time I stood at home again</p>
<p>In Casa Guidi by Felice Church,</p>
<p>Under the doorway where the black begins</p>
<p>With the first stone-slab of the staircase cold,</p>
<p>I had mastered the contents, knew the whole truth</p>
<p>Gathered together, bound up in this book,</p>
<p>Print three-fifths, written supplement the rest.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This power, combined with his power of portraiture, makes this
long poem alive. No other man of his century could paint like him
the to and fro <a name='Page402' id="Page402"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>402</span>of a city, the hurly-burly of humanity, the
crowd, the movement, the changing passions, the loud or quiet clash
of thoughts, the gestures, the dress, the interweaving of
expression on the face, the whole play of humanity in war or peace.
As we read, we move with men and women; we are pressed everywhere
by mankind. We listen to the sound of humanity, sinking sometimes
to the murmur we hear at night from some high window in London;
swelling sometimes, as in <i>Sordello</i>, into a roar of violence,
wrath, revenge, and war. And it was all contained in that little
body, brain and heart; and given to us, who can feel it, but not
give it. This is the power which above all endears him to us as a
poet. We feel in each poem not only the waves of the special event
of which he writes, but also the large vibration of the ocean of
humanity.</p>
<p>He was not unaware of this power of his. We are told in
<i>Sordello</i> that he dedicated himself to the picturing of
humanity; and he came to think that a Power beyond ours had
accepted this dedication, and directed his work. He declares in the
introduction that he felt a Hand ("always above my
shoulder&mdash;mark the predestination"), that pushed him to the
stall where he found the fated book in whose womb lay his
child&mdash;<i>The Ring and the Book</i>. And he believed that he
had certain God-given qualities which fitted him for this work.
These he sets forth in this introduction, and the self-criticism is
of the greatest interest.</p>
<p>The first passage is, when he describes how, having finished the
book and got into him all the gold of its fact, he added from
himself that to the gold which made it workable&mdash;added to it
his live <a name='Page403' id="Page403"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>403</span>soul, informed, transpierced it through and
through with imagination; and then, standing on his balcony over
the street, saw the whole story from the beginning shape itself out
on the night, alive and clear, not in dead memory but in living
movement; saw right away out on the Roman road to Arezzo, and all
that there befell; then passed to Rome again with the actors in the
tragedy, a presence with them who heard them speak and think and
act. The "life in him abolished the death of things&mdash;deep
calling unto deep." For "a spirit laughed and leaped through his
every limb, and lit his eye, and lifted him by the hair, and let
him have his will" with Pompilia, Guido, Caponsacchi, the lawyers,
the Pope, and the whole of Rome. And they rose from the dead; the
old woe stepped on the stage again at the magician's command; and
the rough gold of fact was rounded to a ring by art. But the ring
should have a posy, and he makes that in a passionate cry to his
dead wife&mdash;a lovely spell where high thinking and full feeling
meet and mingle like two deep rivers. Whoso reads it feels how her
spirit, living still for him, brooded over and blest his
masterpiece:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>O lyric Love, half angel and half bird</p>
<p>And all a wonder and a wild desire,&mdash;</p>
<p>Boldest of hearts that ever braved the sun,</p>
<p>Took sanctuary within the holier blue,</p>
<p>And sang a kindred soul out to his face,&mdash;</p>
<p>Yet human at the red-ripe of the heart&mdash;</p>
<p>When the first summons from the darkling earth</p>
<p>Reached thee amid thy chambers, blanched their blue,</p>
<p>And bared them of the glory&mdash;to drop down,</p>
<p>To toil for man, to suffer or to die,&mdash;</p>
<p>This is the same voice: can thy soul know change</p>
<p>Hail then, and hearken from the realms of help!</p>
<p>Never may I commence my song, my due</p>
<p>To God who best taught song by gift of thee,</p>
<a name='Page404' id="Page404"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>404</p>
<p>Except with bent head and beseeching hand&mdash;</p>
<p>That still, despite the distance and the dark,</p>
<p>What was, again may be; some interchange</p>
<p>Of grace, some splendour once thy very thought,</p>
<p>Some benediction anciently thy smile:</p>
<p>&mdash;Never conclude, but raising hand and head</p>
<p>Thither where eyes, that cannot reach, yet yearn</p>
<p>For all hope, all sustainment, all reward,</p>
<p>Their utmost up and on,&mdash;so blessing back</p>
<p>In those thy realms of help, that heaven thy home,</p>
<p>Some whiteness which, I judge, thy face makes proud,</p>
<p>Some wanness where, I think, thy foot may fall!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The poem begins with the view that one half of Rome took of the
events. At the very commencement we touch one of the secondary
interests of the book, the incidental characters. Guido,
Caponsacchi, Pompilia, the Pope, and, in a lesser degree, Violante
and Pietro, are the chief characters, and the main interest
contracts around them. But, through all they say and do, as a
motley crowd through a street, a great number of minor characters
move to and fro; and Browning, whose eye sees every face, and
through the face into the soul, draws them one by one, some more
fully than others in perhaps a hundred lines, some only in ten.
Most of them are types of a class, a profession or a business, yet
there is always a touch or two which isolates each of them so that
they do not only represent a class but a personal character. He
hated, like Morris, the withering of the individual, nor did he
believe, nor any man who knows and feels mankind, that by that the
world grew more and more. The poem is full of such individualities.
It were well, as one example, to read the whole account of the
people who come to see the murdered bodies laid out in the Church
of Lorenzo. The old, curious, doddering gossip of <a name='Page405'
id="Page405"></a><span class='pagenum'>405</span>the Roman street
is not less alive than the Cardinal, and the clever pushing Curato;
and around them are heard the buzz of talk, the movement of the
crowd. The church, the square are humming with humanity.</p>
<p>He does the same clever work at the deathbed of Pompilia. She
lies in the House of the dying, and certain folk are allowed to see
her. Each one is made alive by this creative pencil; and all are
different, one from the other&mdash;the Augustinian monk, old
mother Baldi chattering like a jay who thought that to touch
Pompilia's bedclothes would cure her palsy, Cavalier Carlo who fees
the porter to paint her face just because she was murdered and
famous, the folk who argue on theology over her wounded body.
Elsewhere we possess the life-history of Pietro and Violante,
Pompilia's reputed parents; several drawings of the retired
tradesmen class, with their gossips and friends, in the street of a
poor quarter in Rome; then, the Governor and Archbishop of Arezzo,
the friar who is kindly but fears the world and all the busy-bodies
of this provincial town. Arezzo, its characters and indwellers,
stand in clear light. The most vivid of these sketches is Dominus
Hyacinthus, the lawyer who defends Guido. I do not know anything
better done, and more amusingly, than this man and his
household&mdash;a paternal creature, full of his boys and their
studies, making us, in his garrulous pleasure, at home with them
and his fat wife. Browning was so fond of this sketch that he drew
him and his boys over again in the epilogue.</p>
<p>These represent the episodical characters in this drama of life;
and Browning has scattered them, as <a name='Page406' id=
"Page406"></a><span class='pagenum'>406</span>it were, behind the
chief characters, whom sometimes they illustrate and sometimes they
contrast. Of these the whitest, simplest, loveliest is Pompilia, of
whom I have already written. The other chief characters are Count
Guido and Giuseppe Caponsacchi; and to the full development of
these two characters Browning gives all his powers. They are
contrasted types of the spirit of good and the spirit of evil
conquering in man. Up to a certain point in life their conduct is
much alike. Both belong to the Church&mdash;one as a priest, one as
a layman affiliated to the Church. The lust of money and self, when
the character of Pompilia forces act, turns Guido into a beast of
greed and hate. The same character, when it forces act, lifts
Caponsacchi into almost a saint. This was a piece of contrasted
psychology in which the genius of Browning revelled, and he
followed all the windings of it in both these hearts with the zest
of an explorer. They were labyrinthine, but the more labyrinthine
the better he was pleased. Guido's first speech is made before the
court in his defence. We see disclosed the outer skin of the man's
soul, all that he would have the world know of him&mdash;cynical,
mocking, not cruel, not affectionate, a man of the world whom life
had disappointed, and who wishing to establish himself in a retired
life by marriage had been deceived and betrayed, he pleads, by his
wife and her parents&mdash;an injured soul who, stung at last into
fury at having a son foisted on him, vindicates his honour. And in
this vindication his hypocrisy slips at intervals from him, because
his hatred of his wife is too much for his hypocrisy.</p>
<p>This is the only touch of the wolf in the man&mdash;<a name=
'Page407' id="Page407"></a><span class='pagenum'>407</span>his
cruel teeth shown momentarily through the smooth surface of his
defence. A weaker poet would have left him there, not having
capacity for more. But Browning, so rich in thought he was, had
only begun to draw him. Guido is not only painted by three
others&mdash;by Caponsacchi, by Pompilia, by the Pope&mdash;but he
finally exposes his real self with his own hand. He is condemned to
death. Two of his friends visit him the night before his execution,
in his cell. Then, exalted into eloquence by the fierce passions of
fear of death and hatred of Pompilia, he lays bare as the night his
very soul, mean, cruel, cowardly, hungry for revenge, crying for
life, black with hate&mdash;a revelation such as in literature can
best be paralleled by the soliloquies of Iago. Baseness is supreme
in his speech, hate was never better given; the words are like the
gnashing of teeth; prayers for life at any cost were never meaner,
and the outburst of terror and despair at the end is their ultimate
expression.</p>
<p>Over against him is set Caponsacchi, of noble birth, of refined
manner, one of those polished and cultivated priests of whom Rome
makes such excellent use, and of whom Browning had drawn already a
different type in Bishop Blougram. He hesitated, being young and
gay, to enter the Church. But the archbishop of that easy time, two
hundred years ago, told him the Church was strong enough to bear a
few light priests, and that he would be set free from many
ecclesiastical duties if, by assiduity in society and with women,
he strengthened the social weight of the Church. In that way,
making his madrigals and confessing fine ladies, he lived for four
years. This is an admirable sketch of a type <a name='Page408' id=
"Page408"></a><span class='pagenum'>408</span>of Church society of
that date, indeed, of any date in any Church; it is by no means
confined to Rome.</p>
<p>On this worldly, careless, indifferent, pleasure-seeking soul
Pompilia, in her trouble and the pity of it, rises like a pure star
seen through mist that opens at intervals to show her excelling
brightness; and in a moment, at the first glimpse of her in the
theatre, the false man drops away; his soul breaks up, stands
clear, and claims its divine birth. He is born again, and then
transfigured. The life of convention, of indifference, dies before
Pompilia's eyes; and on the instant he is true to himself, to her,
and to God. The fleeting passions which had absorbed him, and were
of the senses, are burned up, and the spiritual love for her
purity, and for purity itself&mdash;that eternal, infinite
desire&mdash;is now master of his life. Not as Miranda and
Ferdinand changed eyes in youthful love, but as Dante and Beatrice
look on one another in Paradise, did Pompilia and Caponsacchi
change eyes, and know at once that both were true, and see without
speech the central worth of their souls. They trusted one another
and they loved for ever. So, when she cried to him in her distress,
he did her bidding and bore her away to Rome. He tells the story of
their flight, and tells it with extraordinary beauty and vehemence
in her defence. So noble is the tale that he convinces the judges
who at first had disbelieved him; and the Pope confesses that his
imprudence was a higher good than priestly prudence would have
been. When he makes his defence he has heard that Pompilia has been
murdered. Then we understand that in his conversion to goodness he
has not lost but gained passion. Scorn of the judges, who could
<a name='Page409' id="Page409"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>409</span>not see that neither he was guilty nor
Pompilia; fiery indignation with the murderer; infinite grief for
the lamb slain by the wolf, and irrevocable love for the soul of
Pompilia, whom he will dwell with eternally when they meet in
Heaven, a love which Pompilia, dying, declares she has for him, and
in which, growing and abiding, she will wait for him&mdash;burn on
his lips. He is fully and nobly a man; yet, at the end&mdash;and he
is no less a man for it&mdash;the wild sorrow at his heart breaks
him down into a cry:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>O great, just, good God! Miserable me!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Pompilia ends her words more quietly, in the faith that comes
with death. Caponsacchi has to live on, to bear the burden of the
world. But Pompilia has borne all she had to bear. All pain and
horror are behind her, as she lies in the stillness, dying. And in
the fading of this life, she knows she loves Caponsacchi in the
spiritual world and will love him for ever. Each speaks according
to the circumstance, but she most nobly:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>He is ordained to call and I to come!</p>
<p>Do not the dead wear flowers when dressed for God?</p>
<p>Say,&mdash;I am all in flowers from head to foot!</p>
<p>Say,&mdash;not one flower of all he said and did,</p>
<p>Might seem to flit unnoticed, fade unknown,</p>
<p>But dropped a seed, has grown a balsam-tree</p>
<p>Whereof the blossoming perfumes the place</p>
<p>At this supreme of moments! He is a priest;</p>
<p>He cannot marry therefore, which is right:</p>
<p>I think he would not marry if he could.</p>
<p>Marriage on earth seems such a counterfeit,</p>
<p>Mere imitation of the inimitable:</p>
<p>In heaven we have the real and true and sure.</p>
<p>'Tis there they neither marry nor are given</p>
<p>In marriage but are as the angels: right,</p>
<p>Oh how right that is, how like Jesus Christ</p>
<p>To say that! Marriage-making for the earth,</p>
<a name='Page410' id="Page410"></a>
<p class='pagenum'>410</p>
<p>With gold so much,&mdash;birth, power, repute so much,</p>
<p>Or beauty, youth so much, in lack of these!</p>
<p>Be as the angels rather, who, apart,</p>
<p>Know themselves into one, are found at length</p>
<p>Married, but marry never, no, nor give</p>
<p>In marriage; they are man and wife at once</p>
<p>When the true time is; here we have to wait</p>
<p>Not so long neither! Could we by a wish</p>
<p>Have what we will and get the future now,</p>
<p>Would we wish aught done undone in the past?</p>
<p>So, let him wait God's instant men call years;</p>
<p>Meantime hold hard by truth and his great soul,</p>
<p>Do out the duty! Through such souls alone</p>
<p>God stooping shows sufficient of His light</p>
<p>For us i' the dark to rise by. And I rise.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Last of these main characters, the Pope appears. Guido,
condemned to death by the law, appeals from the law to the head of
the Church, because, being half an ecclesiastic, his death can only
finally be decreed by the ecclesiastical arm. An old, old man, with
eyes clear of the quarrels, conventions, class prejudices of the
world, the Pope has gone over all the case during the day, and now
night has fallen. Far from the noise of Rome, removed from the
passions of the chief characters, he is sitting in the stillness of
his closet, set on his decision. We see the whole case now, through
his mind, in absolute quiet. He has been on his terrace to look at
the stars, and their solemn peace is with him. He feels that he is
now alone with God and his old age. And being alone, he is not
concise, but garrulous and discursive. Browning makes him so on
purpose. But discursive as his mind is, his judgment is clear, his
sentence determined. Only, before he speaks, he will weigh all the
characters, and face any doubts that may shoot into his conscience.
He passes Guido and the rest before his spiritual tribunal, judging
not <a name='Page411' id="Page411"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>411</span>from the legal point of view, but from that
which his Master would take at the Judgment Day. How have they
lived; what have they made of life? When circumstances invaded them
with temptation, how did they meet temptation? Did they declare by
what they did that they were on God's side or the devil's? And on
these lines he delivers his sentence on Pompilia, Caponsacchi,
Guido, Pietro, Violante, and the rest. He feels he speaks as the
Vicegerent of God.</p>
<p>This solemn, silent, lonely, unworldly judgment of the whole
case, done in God's presence, is, after the noisy, crowded, worldly
judgment of it by Rome, after the rude humours of the law, and the
terrible clashing of human passions, most impressive; and it rises
into the majesty of old age in the summing up of the characters of
Pompilia, Caponsacchi, and Guido. I wish Browning had left it
there. But he makes a sudden doubt invade the Pope with a chill.
Has he judged rightly in thinking that divine truth is with him? Is
there any divine truth on which he may infallibly repose?</p>
<p>And then for many pages we are borne away into a theological
discussion, which I take leave to say is wearisome; and which,
after all, lands the Pope exactly at the point from which he set
out&mdash;a conclusion at which, as we could have told him
beforehand, he would be certain to arrive. We might have been
spared this. It is an instance of Browning's pleasure in
intellectual discourse which had, as I have said, such sad results
on his imaginative work. However, at the end, the Pope resumes his
interest in human life. He determines; and quickly&mdash;"Let the
murderer die to-morrow."</p>
<p><a name='Page412' id="Page412"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>412</span>Then comes the dreadful passion of Guido in the
condemned cell, of which I have spoken. And then, one would think
the poem would have closed. But no, the epilogue succeeds, in
which, after all the tragedy, humour reigns supreme. It brings us
into touch with all that happened in this case after the execution
of Guido; the letters written by the spectators, the lawyer's view
of the deed, the gossip of Rome upon the interesting occasion. No
piece of humour in Browning's poetry, and no portrait-sketching, is
better than the letter written by a Venetian gentleman in Rome
giving an account of the execution. It is high comedy when we are
told that the Austrian Ambassador, who had pleaded for Guido's
life, was so vexed by the sharp "no" of the Pope (even when he had
told the Pope that he had probably dined at the same table with
Guido), that he very nearly refused to come to the execution, and
would scarcely vouchsafe it more than a glance when he did
come&mdash;as if this conduct of his were a slight which the Pope
would feel acutely. Nor does Browning's invention stop with this
inimitable letter. He adds two other letters which he found among
the papers; and these give to the characters of the two lawyers,
new turns, new images of their steady professional ambition not to
find truth, but to gain the world.</p>
<p>One would think, after this, that invention would be weary. Not
at all! The Augustinian monk who attended Pompilia has not had
attention enough; and this is the place, Browning thinks, to show
what he thought of the case, and how he used it in his profession.
So, we are given a great part of the sermon he preached on the
occasion, and the various judgments of Rome upon it.</p>
<p><a name='Page413' id="Page413"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>413</span>It is wonderful, after invention has been
actively at work for eleven long books, pouring forth its waters
from an unfailing fountain, to find it, at the end, as gay, as
fresh, as keen, as youthful as ever. This, I repeat, is the
excellence of Browning's genius&mdash;fulness of creative power,
with imagination in it like a fire. It does not follow that all it
produces is poetry; and what it has produced in <i>The Ring and the
Book</i> is sometimes, save for the metre, nothing better than
prose. But this is redeemed by the noble poetry of a great part of
it. The book is, as I have said, a mixed book&mdash;the central
arena of that struggle in Browning between prose and poetry with a
discussion of which this chapter began, and with the mention of
which I finish it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3><i>LATER POEMS</i></h3>
<p>A just appreciation of the work which Browning published after
<i>The Ring and the Book</i> is a difficult task. The poems are of
various kinds, on widely separated subjects; and with the exception
of those which treat of Balaustion, they have no connection with
one another. Many of them must belong to the earlier periods of his
life, and been introduced into the volumes out of the crowd of
unpublished poems every poet seems to possess. These, when we come
across them among their middle-aged companions, make a strange
impression, as if we found a white-thorn flowering in an autumnal
woodland; and in previous chapters of this book I have often
fetched them out of their places, and considered them where they
ought to be&mdash;in the happier air and light in which they were
born. I will not discuss them again, but in forming any judgment of
the later poems they must be discarded.</p>
<p>The struggle to which I have drawn attention between the
imaginative and intellectual elements in Browning, and which was
equally balanced in <i>The Ring and the Book</i>, continued after
its publication, but with a steady lessening of the imaginative and
<a name='Page415' id="Page415"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>415</span>a steady increase of the intellectual elements.
One poem, however, written before the publication of <i>The Ring
and the Book</i>, does not belong to this struggle. This is
<i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i>, a ballad of fire and joy and triumph. It
is curiously French in sentiment and expression, and the eager
sea-delight in it is plainly French, not English in feeling. Nor is
it only French; it is Breton in audacity, in self-forgetfulness, in
carelessness of reward, and in loyalty to country, to love and to
home. If Browning had been all English, this transference of
himself into the soul of another nationality would have been
wonderful, nay, impossible. As it is, it is wonderful enough; and
this self-transference&mdash;one of his finest poetic
powers&mdash;is nowhere better accomplished than in this poem, full
of the salt wind and the leap and joy of the sea-waves; but even
more full, as was natural to Browning, of the Breton soul of
Herv&eacute; Riel.</p>
<p>In <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> (1871) which next appeared, the
imaginative elements, as we have seen, are still alive and happy;
and though they only emerge at intervals in its continuation,
<i>Aristophanes' Apology</i> (1875), yet they do emerge. Meanwhile,
between <i>Balaustion's Adventure</i> and the end of 1875, he
produced four poems&mdash;<i>Prince Hohenstiel Schwangau, Saviour
of Society; Fifine at the Fair; Red Cotton Nightcap Country, or
Turf and Towers</i>; and <i>The Inn Album</i>. They are all long,
and were published in four separate volumes. In them the
intellectual elements have all but completely conquered the
imaginative. They are, however, favourite "exercise-places" for
some of his admirers, who think that they derive poetic pleasures
from their <a name='Page416' id="Page416"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>416</span>study. The pleasure these poems give, when they
give it, is not altogether a poetic pleasure. It is chiefly the
pleasure of the understanding called to solve with excitement a
huddle of metaphysical problems. They have the name but not the
nature of poetry.</p>
<p>They are the work of my Lord Intelligence&mdash;attended by wit
and fancy&mdash;who sits at the desk of poetry, and with her pen in
his hand. He uses the furniture of poetry, but the goddess herself
has left the room. Yet something of her influence still fills the
air of the chamber. In the midst of the brilliant display that
fancy, wit, and intellect are making, a soft steady light of pure
song burns briefly at intervals, and then is quenched; like the
light of stars seen for a moment of quiet effulgence among the
crackling and dazzling of fireworks.</p>
<p>The poems are, it is true, original. We cannot class them with
any previous poetry. They cannot be called didactic or satirical.
The didactic and satirical poems of England are, for the most part,
artificial, concise, clear. These poems are not artificial, clear
or concise. Nor do they represent the men and women of a cultured,
intellectual and conventional society, such as the poetry of Dryden
and Pope addressed. The natural man is in them&mdash;the crude,
dull, badly-baked man&mdash;what the later nineteenth century
called the real man. We see his ugly, sordid, contemptible,
fettered soul, and long for Salinguerra, or Lippo Lippi, or even
Caliban. The representations are then human enough, with this kind
of humanity, but they might have been left to prose. Poetry has no
business to build its houses on the waste and leprous lands of
human <a name='Page417' id="Page417"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>417</span>nature; and less business to call its work art.
Realism of this kind is not art, it is science.</p>
<p>Yet the poems are not scientific, for they have no clarity of
argument. Their wanderings of thought are as intertangled as the
sheep-walks on league after league of high grasslands. When one has
a fancy to follow them, the pursuit is entertaining; but unless one
has the fancy, there are livelier employments. Their chief interest
is the impression they give us of a certain side of Browning's
character. They are his darling debauch of cleverness, of
surface-psychology. The analysis follows no conventional lines,
does not take or oppose any well-known philosophical side. It is
not much more than his own serious or fantastic thinking indulging
itself with reckless abandon&mdash;amusing itself with itself. And
this gives them a humanity&mdash;a Browning humanity&mdash;outside
of their subjects.</p>
<p>The subjects too, though not delightful, are founded on facts of
human life. <i>Bishop Blougram</i> was conceived from Cardinal
Wiseman's career, <i>Mr. Sludge</i> from Mr. Home's. <i>Prince
Hohenstiel Schwangau</i> explains and defends the expediency by
which Napoleon III. directed his political action. <i>The Inn
Album, Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i>, are taken from actual
stories that occurred while Browning was alive, and <i>Fifine at
the Fair</i> analyses a common crisis in the maturer lives of men
and women. The poems thus keep close to special cases,
yet&mdash;and in this the poet appears&mdash;they have an extension
which carries them beyond the particular subjects into the needs
and doings of a wider humanity. Their little rivers run into the
great sea. They have then their human interest for a reader who
does not wish for <a name='Page418' id="Page418"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>418</span>beauty, passion, imagination, or the desires of
the spirit in his poetry; but who hankers at his solitary desk
after realistic psychology, fanciful ethics, curiosities of
personal philosophy, cold intellectual play with argument, and
honest human ugliness.</p>
<p>Moreover, the method Browning attempts to use in them for the
discovery of truth is not the method of poetry, nor of any of the
arts. It is almost a commonplace to say that the world of mankind
and each individual in it only arrives at the truth on any matter,
large or small, by going through and exhausting the false forms of
that truth&mdash;and a very curious arrangement it seems to be. It
is this method Browning pursues in these poems. He represents one
after another various false or half-true views of the matter in
hand, and hopes in that fashion to clear the way to the truth. But
he fails to convince partly because it is impossible to give all or
enough of the false or half-true views of any one truth, but
chiefly because his method is one fitted for philosophy or science,
but not for poetry. Poetry claims to see and feel the truth at
once. When the poet does not assert that claim, and act on it, he
is becoming faithless to his art.</p>
<p>Browning's method in these poems is the method of a scientific
philosopher, not of an artist. He gets his man into a debateable
situation; the man debates it from various points of view; persons
are introduced who take other aspects of the question, or
personified abstractions such as <i>Sagacity, Reason, Fancy</i>
give their opinions. Not satisfied with this, Browning discusses it
again from his own point of view. He is then like the chess-player
who himself plays both red and white; who tries to keep both
<a name='Page419' id="Page419"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>419</span>distinct in his mind, but cannot help now and
again taking one side more than the other; and who is frequently a
third person aware of himself as playing red, and also of himself
as playing white; and again of himself as outside both the players
and criticising their several games. This is no exaggerated account
of what is done in these poems. Three people, even when the poems
are monologues, are arguing in them, and Browning plays all their
hands, even in <i>The Inn Album</i>, which is not a monologue. In
<i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i>, when he has told the story of
the man and woman in all its sordid and insane detail, with
comments of his own, he brings the victim of mean pleasure and mean
superstition to the top of the tower whence he throws himself down,
and, inserting his intelligence into the soul of the man, explains
his own view of the situation. In <i>Prince Hohenstiel
Schwangau</i>, we have sometimes what Browning really thinks, as in
the beginning of the poem, about the matter in hand, and then what
he thinks the Prince would think, and then, to complicate the
affair still more, the Prince divides himself, and makes a
personage called <i>Sagacity</i> argue with him on the whole
situation. As to <i>Fifine at the Fair</i>&mdash;a poem it would
not be fair to class altogether with these&mdash;its involutions
resemble a number of live eels in a tub of water. Don Juan changes
his personality and his views like a player on the stage who takes
several parts; Elvire is a gliding phantom with gliding opinions;
Fifine is real, but she remains outside of this shifting scenery of
the mind; and Browning, who continually intrudes, is sometimes Don
Juan and sometimes himself and sometimes both together, and
<a name='Page420' id="Page420"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>420</span>sometimes another thinker who strives to bring,
as in the visions in the poem, some definition into this changing
cloudland of the brain. And after all, not one of the questions
posed in any of the poems is settled in the end. I do not say that
the leaving of the questions unsettled is not like life. It is very
like life, but not like the work of poetry, whose high office it is
to decide questions which cannot be solved by the
understanding.</p>
<p>Bishop Blongram thinks he has proved his points. Gigadibs is
half convinced he has. But the Bishop, on looking back, thinks he
has not been quite sincere, that his reasonings were only good for
the occasion. He has evaded the centre of the thing. What he has
said was no more than intellectual fencing. It certainly is
intellectual fencing of the finest kind. Both the Bishop and his
companion are drawn to the life; yet, and this is the cleverest
thing in the poem, we know that the Bishop is in reality a
different man from the picture he makes of himself. And the truth
which in his talk underlies its appearance acts on Gigadibs and
sends him into a higher life. The discussion&mdash;as it may be
called though the Bishop only speaks&mdash;concerning faith and
doubt is full of admirable wisdom, and urges me to modify my
statement that Browning took little or no interest in the
controversies of his time. Yet, all through the fencing, nothing is
decided. The button is always on the Bishop's foil. He never sends
the rapier home. And no doubt that is the reason that his
companion, with "his sudden healthy vehemence" did drive his weapon
home into life&mdash;and started for Australia.</p>
<p>Mr. Sludge, the medium, excuses his imposture, <a name='Page421'
id="Page421"></a><span class='pagenum'>421</span>and then thinks
"it may not altogether be imposture. For all he knows there may
really be spirits at the bottom of it. He never meant to cheat; yet
he did cheat. Yet, even if he lied, lies help truth to live; and he
must live himself; and God may have made fools for him to live on;"
and many other are the twists of his defence. The poem is as
lifelike in its insight into the mind of a supple cheat as it is a
brilliant bit of literature; but Browning leaves the matter
unconcluded, as he would not have done, I hold, had he been writing
poetry. Prince Hohenstiel's defence of expediency in politics is
made by Browning to seem now right, now wrong, because he assumes
at one time what is true as the ground of his argument, and then at
another what is plainly false, and in neither case do the
assumptions support the arguments. What really is concluded is not
the question, but the slipperiness of the man who argues. And at
the end of the poem Browning comes in again to say that words
cannot be trusted to hit truth. Language is inadequate to express
it. Browning was fond of saying this. It does not seem worth
saying. In one sense it is a truism; in another it resembles
nonsense. Words are the only way by which we can express truth, or
our nearest approach to what we think it is. At any rate, silence,
in spite of Maeterlinck, does not express it. Moreover, with regard
to the matter in hand, Browning knew well enough how a poet would
decide the question of expediency he has here brought into debate.
He has decided it elsewhere; but here he chooses not to take that
view, that he may have the fun of exercising his clever brain.
There is no reason why he should not entertain <a name='Page422'
id="Page422"></a><span class='pagenum'>422</span>himself and us in
this way; but folk need not call this intellectual jumping to and
fro a poem, or try to induce us to believe that it is the work of
art.</p>
<p>When he had finished these products of a time when he was
intoxicated with his intellect, and of course somewhat proud of it,
the poet in him began to revive. This resurrection had begun in
<i>Fifine at the Fair</i>. I have said it would not be just to
class this poem with the other three. It has many an oasis of
poetry where it is a happiness to rest. But the way between their
palms and wells is somewhat dreary walking, except to those who
adore minute psychology. The poem is pitilessly long. If throughout
its length it were easy to follow we might excuse the length, but
it is rendered difficult by the incessant interchange of misty
personalities represented by one personality. Elvire, Fifine only
exist in the mind of Don Juan; their thoughts are only expressed in
his words; their outlines not only continually fade into his, but
his thought steals into his presentation of their thought, till it
becomes impossible to individualise them. The form in which
Browning wrote the poem, by which he made Don Juan speak for them,
makes this want of clearness and sharpness inevitable. The work is
done with a terrible cleverness, but it is wearisome at the
last.</p>
<p>The length also might be excused if the subject were a great one
or had important issues for mankind. But, though it has its
interest and is human enough, it does not deserve so many thousand
lines nor so much elaborate analysis. A few lyrics or a drama of
two acts might say all that is worth saying on the matter. What
Browning has taken for subject <a name='Page423' id=
"Page423"></a><span class='pagenum'>423</span>is an every-day
occurrence. We are grateful to him for writing on so universal a
matter, even though it is unimportant; and he has tried to make it
uncommon and important by weaving round it an intricate lace-work
of psychology; yet, when we get down to its main lines, it is the
ordinary event, especially commonplace in any idle society which
clings to outward respectability and is dreadfully wearied of it.
Our neighbours across the Channel call it <i>La Crise</i> when,
after years of a quiet, not unhappy, excellent married existence,
day succeeding day in unbroken continuity of easy affection and
limited experience, the man or the woman, in full middle life,
suddenly wearies of the apparent monotony, the uneventful love, the
slow encroaching tide of the commonplace, and looks on these as
fetters on their freedom, as walls which shut them in from the
vivid interests of the outside world, from the gipsy roving of the
passions. The time arrives, when this becomes, they think, too
great for endurance, and their impatience shows itself in a daily
irritability quite new in the household, apparently causeless, full
of sudden, inexplicable turns of thought and act which turn the
peaceful into a tempestuous home. It is not that the husband or the
wife are inconstant by nature&mdash;to call <i>Fifine at the
Fair</i> a defence of inconstancy is to lose the truth of the
matter&mdash;but it is the desire of momentary change, of a life
set free from conventional barriers, of an outburst into the
unknown, of the desire for new experiences, for something which
will bring into play those parts of their nature of which they are
vaguely conscious but which are as yet unused&mdash;new elements in
their senses, intellect, imagination, even in their <a name=
'Page424' id="Page424"></a><span class='pagenum'>424</span>spirit,
but not always in their conscience. That, for the time being, as in
this poem, is often shut up in the cellar, where its voice cannot
be heard.</p>
<p>This is, as I said, a crisis of common occurrence. It may be
rightly directed, its evil controlled, and a noble object chosen
for the satisfaction of the impulse. Here, that is not the case;
and Browning describes its beginning with great freshness and force
as Juan walks down to the fair with Elvire. Nor has he omitted to
treat other forms of it in his poetry. He knew how usual it was,
but he has here made it unusual by putting it into the heart of a
man who, before he yielded to it, was pleased to make it the
subject of a wandering metaphysical analysis; who sees not only how
it appears to himself in three or four moods, but how it looks to
the weary, half-jealous wife to whom he is so rude while he strives
to be courteous, and to the bold, free, conscienceless child of
nature whose favour he buys, and with whom, after all his barren
metaphysics, he departs, only to attain, when his brief spell of
foolish freedom is over, loneliness and cynic satiety. It may amuse
us to circle with him through his arguments, though every one knows
he will yield at last and that yielding is more honest than his
talk; but what we ask is&mdash;Was the matter worth the trouble of
more than two thousand lines of long-winded verse? Was it worth an
artist's devotion? or, to ask a question I would not ask if the
poem were good art, is it of any real importance to mankind? Is it,
finally, anything more than an intellectual exercise of Browning on
which solitary psychologists may, in their turn, employ their neat
intelligence? This poem, with the exceptions of <a name='Page425'
id="Page425"></a><span class='pagenum'>425</span>some episodes of
noble poetry, is, as well as the three others, a very harlequinade
of the intellect.</p>
<p>I may say, though this is hypercritical, that the name of Don
Juan is a mistake. Every one knows Don Juan, and to imagine him
arguing in the fashion of this poem is absurd. He would instantly,
without a word, have left Elvire, and abandoned Fifine in a few
days. The connection then of the long discussions in the poem with
his name throws an air of unreality over the whole of it. The Don
Juan of the poem had much better have stayed with Elvire, who
endured him with weary patience. I have no doubt that he bored
Fifine to extinction.</p>
<p>The poems that follow these four volumes are mixed work, half
imaginative, half intellectual. Sometimes both kinds are found,
separated, in the same poem; sometimes in one volume half the poems
will be imaginative and the other half not. Could the imaginative
and intellectual elements have now been fused as they were in his
earlier work, it were well; but they were not. They worked apart.
His witful poems are all wit, his analytical poems are all
analysis, and his imaginative poems, owing to this want of fusion,
have not the same intellectual strength they had in other days.
<i>Numpholeptos</i>, for instance, an imaginative poem, full too of
refined and fanciful emotion, is curiously wanting in intellectual
foundation.</p>
<p>The <i>Numpholeptos</i> is in the volume entitled
<i>Pacchiarotto, and how he worked in Distemper</i>. Part of the
poems in it are humorous, such as <i>Pacchiarotto</i> and
<i>Filippo Baldinucci</i>, excellent pieces of agreeable wit,
containing excellent advice concerning life. One reads them, is
amused by them, and rarely desires <a name='Page426' id=
"Page426"></a><span class='pagenum'>426</span>to read them again.
In the same volume there are some severe pieces, sharply ridiculing
his critics. In the old days, when he wrote fine imaginative
poetry, out of his heart and brain working together, he did not
mind what the critics said, and only flashed a scoff or two at them
in his creation of Naddo in <i>Sordello</i>. But now when he wrote
a great deal of his poetry out of his brain alone, he became
sensitive to criticism. For that sort of poetry does not rest on
the sure foundation which is given by the consciousness the
imagination has of its absolute rightness. He expresses his
needless soreness with plenty of wit in <i>Pacchiarotto</i> and in
the <i>Epilogue</i>, criticises his critics, and displays his good
opinion of his work&mdash;no doubt of these later poems, like
<i>The Inn Album</i> and the rest&mdash;with a little too much of
self-congratulation. "The poets pour us wine," he says, "and mine
is strong&mdash;the strong wine of the loves and hates and thoughts
of man. But it is not sweet as well, and my critics object. Were it
so, it would be more popular than it is. Sweetness and strength do
not go together, and I have strength."</p>
<p>But that is not the real question. The question is&mdash;Is the
strength poetical? Has it imagination? It is rough, powerful, full
of humanity, and that is well. But is it half prose, or wholly
prose? Or is it poetry, or fit to be called so? He thinks that
<i>Prince Hohenstiel</i>, or <i>Red Cotton Nightcap Country</i>,
are poetry. They are, it is true, strong; and they are not sweet.
But have they the strength of poetry in them, and not the strength
of something else altogether? That is the question he ought to have
answered, and it does not occur to him.</p>
<p>Yet, he was, in this very book, half-way out of <a name=
'Page427' id="Page427"></a><span class='pagenum'>427</span>this
muddle. There are poems in it, just as strong as <i>The Inn
Album</i>, but with the ineffable spirit of imaginative emotion and
thought clasped together in them, so that the strong is stronger,
and the humanity deeper than in the pieces he thought, being
deceived by the Understanding, were more strong than the poems of
old. In <i>Bifurcation</i>, in <i>St. Martin's Summer</i>, the
diviner spirit breathes. There is that other poem called
<i>Forgiveness</i> of which I have already spoken&mdash;one of his
masterpieces. <i>Cenciaja</i>, which may be classed with
<i>Forgiveness</i> as a study of the passion of hatred, is not so
good as its comrade, but its hatred is shown in a mean character
and for a meaner motive. And the <i>Prologue</i>, in its rhythm and
pleasure, its subtlety of thought, its depth of feeling, and its
close union of both, recalls his earlier genius.</p>
<p>The first of the <i>Pisgah Sights</i> is a jewel. It is like a
poem by Goethe, only Goethe would have seen the "sight" not when he
was dying, but when he was alive to his finger-tips. The second is
not like Goethe's work, nor Browning's; but it is a true picture of
what many feel and are. So is <i>Fears and Scruples</i>. As to
<i>Natural Magic</i>, surely it is the most charming of
compliments, most enchantingly expressed.</p>
<p>The next volume of original poems was <i>La Saisiaz</i> and the
<i>Two Poets of Croisic</i>. The <i>Croisic Poets</i> are agreeable
studies, written with verve and lucidity, of two fantastic events
which lifted these commonplace poets suddenly into fame. They do
well to amuse an idle hour. The end of both is interesting. That of
the first, which begins with stanza lix., discusses the question:
"Who cares, <a name='Page428' id="Page428"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>428</span>how such a mediocrity as Ren&eacute; lived
after the fame of his prophecy died out?"<a name='FNanchor_11_11'
id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href='#Footnote_11_11'>[11]</a> And
Browning answers&mdash;</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Well, I care&mdash;intimately care to have</p>
<p class='i2'>Experience how a human creature felt</p>
<p>In after life, who bore the burthen grave</p>
<p class='i2'>Of certainly believing God had dealt</p>
<p>For once directly with him: did not rave</p>
<p class='i2'>&mdash;A maniac, did not find his reason melt</p>
<p>&mdash;An idiot, but went on, in peace or strife,</p>
<p>The world's way, lived an ordinary life.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The solution Browning offers is interesting, because it recalls
a part of the experiences of Lazarus in the <i>Epistle to
Karshish</i>. Ren&eacute;, like Lazarus, but only for a moment, has
lived in the eternal.</p>
<p>Are such revelations possible, is his second question. Yes, he
answers; and the form of the answer belongs to the theory of life
laid down in <i>Paracelsus</i>. Such sudden openings of the greater
world are at intervals, as to Abt Vogler, given by God to men.</p>
<p>The end of the second asks what is the true test of the greater
poet, when people take on them to weigh the worth of
poets&mdash;who was better, best, this, that or the other bard?
When I read this I trembled, knowing that I had compared him with
Tennyson. But when I heard the answer I trembled no more. "The best
poet of any two is the one who leads the happier life. The strong
and <a name='Page429' id="Page429"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>429</span>joyful poet is the greater." But this is a test
of the greatness of a man, not necessarily of a poet. And,
moreover, in this case, Tennyson and Browning both lived equally
happy lives. Both were strong to the end, and imaginative joy was
their companion. But the verse in which Browning winds up his
answer is one of the finest in his poetry.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>So, force is sorrow, and each sorrow, force;</p>
<p class='i2'>What then? since Swiftness gives the charioteer</p>
<p>The palm, his hope be in the vivid horse</p>
<p class='i2'>Whose neck God clothed with thunder, not the
steer</p>
<p>Sluggish and safe! Yoke Hatred, Crime, Remorse,</p>
<p class='i2'>Despair; but ever mid the whirling fear,</p>
<p class='i2'>Let, through the tumult, break the poet's face</p>
<p class='i2'>Radiant, assured his wild slaves win the race!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><i>La Saisiaz</i> is a more important poem: it describes the
sudden death of his friend, Ann Egerton Smith, and passes from
that, and all he felt concerning it, into an argument on the future
life of the soul, with the assumption that God is, and the soul.
The argument is interesting, but does not concern us here. What
does concern us is that Browning has largely recovered his poetical
way of treating a subject. He is no longer outside of it, but in
it. He does not use it as a means of exercising his brains only. It
is steeped in true and vital feeling, and the deep friendship he
had for his friend fills even the theological argument with a
passionate intensity. Nevertheless, the argument is perilously near
the work of the understanding alone&mdash;as if a question like
that of immortality could receive any solution from the hands of
the understanding. Only each man, in the recesses of his own spirit
with God, can solve that question for himself, and not for another.
That is Browning's position when <a name='Page430' id=
"Page430"></a><span class='pagenum'>430</span>he writes as a poet,
and no one has written more positively on the subject. But when he
submits the question to reasoning, he wavers, as he does here, and
leaves the question more undecided than anywhere else in his work.
This is a pity, but it is the natural penalty of his partial
abandonment of the poetic for the prosaic realm, of the imagination
for the understanding, of the Reason for reasoning.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3><i>THE LAST POEMS</i></h3>
<p>Two Volumes of Dramatic Idyls, one in 1879, the other in 1880,
followed <i>La Saisiaz</i> and <i>The Two Poets of Croisic</i>.
These are also mixed books, composed, partly of studies of
character written in rhythmical prose, and partly of poems wrought
out of the pure imagination. Three of them&mdash;if they were
written at this time&mdash;show how the Greek legends still dwelt
with Browning; and they brought with them the ocean-scent, heroic
life, and mythical charm of Athenian thought. It would be
difficult, if one could write of them at all, not to write of them
poetically; and <i>Pheidippides, Echetlos, Pan and Luna</i> are
alive with force, imaginative joy, and the victorious sense the
poet has of having conquered his material. <i>Pheidippides</i> is
as full of fire, of careless heroism as <i>Herv&eacute; Riel</i>,
and told in as ringing verse. The versing of <i>Echetlos</i>, its
rugged, rousing sound, its movement, are in most excellent harmony
with the image of the rude, giant "Holder of the ploughshare," who
at Marathon drove his furrows through the Persians and rooted up
the Mede. Browning has gathered into one picture and one sound the
whole spirit of the story. <i>Pan and Luna</i> is a bold
re-rendering of the myth that Vergil <a name='Page432' id=
"Page432"></a><span class='pagenum'>432</span>enshrines, and the
greater part of it is of such poetic freshness that I think it must
be a waif from the earlier years of his poetry. Nor is there better
imaginative work in his descriptive poetry than the image of the
naked moon, in virginal distress, flying for refuge through the
gazing heaven to the succourable cloud&mdash;fleece on fleece of
piled-up snow, drowsily patient&mdash;where Pan lay in ambush for
her beauty.</p>
<p>Among these more gracious idyls, one of singular rough power
tells the ghastly tale of the mother who gave up her little
children to the wolves to save herself. Browning liked this poem,
and the end he added to the story&mdash;how the carpenter, Ivan,
when the poor frightened woman confessed, lifted his axe and cut
off her head; how he knew that he did right, and was held to have
done right by the village and its pope. The sin by which a mother
sacrificed the lives of her children to save her own was out of
nature: the punishment should be outside of ordinary law. It is a
piteous tale, and few things in Browning equal the horror of the
mother's vain attempt to hide her crime while she confesses it. Nor
does he often show greater imaginative skill in metrical movement
than when he describes in galloping and pattering verse the grey
pack emerging from the forest, their wild race for the sledge, and
their demon leader.</p>
<p>The other idyls in these two volumes are full of interest for
those who care for psychological studies expressed in verse. What
the vehicle of verse does for them is to secure conciseness and
suggestiveness in the rendering of remote, daring, and unexpected
turns of thought and feeling, and especially of conscience. Yet the
poems themselves cannot be called <a name='Page433' id=
"Page433"></a><span class='pagenum'>433</span>concise. Their
subjects are not large enough, nor indeed agreeable enough, to
excuse their length. Goethe would have put them into a short
lyrical form. It is impossible not to regret, as we read them, the
Browning of the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>. Moreover, some of them are
needlessly ugly. <i>Halbert and Hob</i>&mdash;and in
<i>Jocoseria</i>&mdash;<i>Donald</i>, are hateful subjects, and
their treatment does not redeem them; unlike the treatment of
<i>Ivan Ivanovitch</i> which does lift the pain of the story into
the high realms of pity and justice. Death, swift death, was not
only the right judgment, but also the most pitiful. Had the mother
lived, an hour's memory would have been intolerable torture.
Nevertheless, if Browning, in his desire to represent the whole of
humanity, chose to treat these lower forms of human nature, I
suppose we must accept them as an integral part of his work; and,
at least, there can be no doubt of their ability, and of the
brilliancy of their psychological surprises. <i>Ned Bratts</i> is a
monument of cleverness, as well as of fine characterisation of a
momentary outburst of conscience in a man who had none before; and
who would have lost it in an hour, had he not been hanged on the
spot. The quick, agile, unpremeditated turns of wit in this poem,
as in some of the others, are admirably easy, and happily
expressed. Indeed, in these later poems of character and event,
ingenuity or nimbleness of intellect is the chief element, and it
is accompanied by a facile power which is sometimes rude, often
careless, always inventive, fully fantastical, and rarely
imaginative in the highest sense of the word. Moreover, as was not
the case of old, they have, beyond the story, a direct teaching
<a name='Page434' id="Page434"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>434</span>aim, which, while it lowers them as art, is
very agreeable to the ethical psychologist.</p>
<p><i>Jocoseria</i> has poems of a higher quality, some of which,
like the lovely <i>Never the Time and Place</i>, I have been
already quoted. <i>Ixion</i> is too obscurely put to attain its end
with the general public. But it may be recommended, though vainly,
to those theologians who, hungry for the Divine Right of torture,
build their God, like Caliban, out of their own minds; who, foolish
enough to believe that the everlasting endurance of evil is a
necessary guarantee of the everlasting endurance of good, are still
bold and bad enough to proclaim the abominable lie of eternal
punishment. They need that spirit the little child whom Christ
placed in the midst of his disciples; and in gaining which, after
living the life of the lover, the warrior, the poet, the statesman,
<i>Jochanan Hakkadosh</i> found absolute peace and joy. Few poems
contain more of Browning's matured theory of life than this of the
Jewish Rabbi; and its seriousness is happily mingled with
imaginative illustrations and with racy wit. The sketch of Tsaddik,
who puts us in mind of Wagner in the <i>Faust</i>, is done with a
sarcastic joy in exposing the Philistine, and with a delight in its
own cleverness which is fascinating.</p>
<p><i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i> and <i>Parleyings with Certain
People</i> followed <i>Jocoseria</i> in 1884 and 1887. The first of
these books is much the better of the two. A certain touch of
romance is given by the Dervish, by the Fables with which he
illustrates his teaching, and by the Eastern surroundings. Some of
the stories are well told, and their scenery is truthfully wrought
and in good colour. The sub<a name='Page435' id=
"Page435"></a><span class='pagenum'>435</span>jects are partly
theological, with always a reference to human life; and partly of
the affections and their working. It is natural to a poet, and
delightful in Browning, to find him in his old age dwelling from
poem to poem on the pre-eminence of love, on love as the ultimate
judge of all questions. He asserts this again and again; with the
greatest force in <i>A Pillar at Sebzevar</i>, and, more lightly,
in <i>Cherries</i>. Yet, and this is a pity, he is not satisfied
with the decision of love, but spends pages in argumentative
discussions which lead him away from that poetical treatment of the
subjects which love alone, as the master, would have enabled him to
give. However, the treatment that love gives we find in the lyrics
at the end of each <i>Fancy</i>; and some of these lyrics are of
such delicate and subtle beauty that I am tempted to think that
they were written at an earlier period, and their <i>Fancies</i>
composed to fit them. If they were written now, it is plain that
age had not disenabled him from walking with pleasure and power
among those sweet, enamelled meadows of poetry in whose soil he now
thought great poetry did not grow. And when we read the lyrics, our
regret is all the more deep that he chose the thorn-clad and desert
lands, where barren argument goes round and round its subjects
without ever finding the true path to their centre.</p>
<p>He lost himself more completely in this error in <i>Parleyings
with Certain People</i>, in which book, with the exception of the
visionary landscapes in <i>Gerard de Lairesse</i>, and some few
passages in <i>Francis Furini</i> and <i>Charles Avison</i>,
imagination, such as belongs to a poet, has deserted Browning. He
feels himself as if this might be said of <a name='Page436' id=
"Page436"></a><span class='pagenum'>436</span>him; and he asks in
<i>Gerard de Lairesse</i> if he has lost the poetic touch, the
poetic spirit, because he writes of the soul, of facts, of things
invisible&mdash;not of fancy's feignings, not of the things
perceived by the senses? "I can do this," he answers, "if I like,
as well as you," and he paints the landscape of a whole day filled
with mythological figures. The passage is poetry; we see that he
has not lost his poetic genius. But, he calls it "fooling," and
then contrasts the spirit of Greek lore with the spirit of immortal
hope and cheer which he possesses, with his faith that there is for
man a certainty of Spring. But that is not the answer to his
question. It only says that the spirit which animates him now is
higher than the Greek spirit. It does not answer the
question&mdash;Whether <i>Daniel Bartoli</i> or <i>Charles
Avison</i> or any of these <i>Parleyings</i> even approach as
poetry <i>Paracelsus</i>, the <i>Dramatic Lyrics</i>, or <i>Men and
Women</i>. They do not. Nor has their intellectual work the same
force, unexpectedness and certainty it had of old. Nevertheless,
these <i>Parleyings</i>, at the close of the poet's life, and with
biographical touches which give them vitality, enshrine Browning's
convictions with regard to some of the greater and lesser problems
of human life. And when his personality is vividly present in them,
the argument, being thrilled with passionate feeling, rises, but
heavily like a wounded eagle, into an imaginative world.</p>
<p>The sub-consciousness in Browning's mind to which I have
alluded&mdash;that these later productions of his were not as
poetical as his earlier work and needed defence&mdash;is the real
subject of a remarkable little poem at the end of the second volume
of the <i>Dramatic Idyls</i>. He is thinking of himself as poet,
<a name='Page437' id="Page437"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>437</span>perhaps of that double nature in him which on
one side was quick to see and love beauty; and on the other, to see
facts and love their strength. Sometimes the sensitive
predominated. He was only the lover of beauty whom everything that
touched him urged into song.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Touch him ne'er so lightly, into song he broke:</p>
<p class='i2'>Soil so quick-receptive,&mdash;not one
feather-seed,</p>
<p>Not one flower-dust fell but straight its fall awoke</p>
<p class='i2'>Vitalising virtue: song would song succeed</p>
<p class='i2'>Sudden as spontaneous&mdash;prove a poet-soul!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>This, which Browning puts on the lips of another, is not meant,
we are told, to describe himself. But it does describe one side of
him very well, and the origin and conduct of a number of his
earlier poems. But now, having changed his manner, even the
principles of his poetry, he describes himself as different from
that&mdash;as a sterner, more iron poet, and the work he now does
as more likely to endure, and be a power in the world of men. He
was curiously mistaken.</p>
<p>Indeed, he cries, is that the soil in which a poet grows?</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>"Rock's the song-soil rather, surface hard and bare:</p>
<p>Sun and dew their mildness, storm and frost their rage</p>
<p class='i2'>Vainly both expend,&mdash;few flowers awaken
there:</p>
<p>Quiet in its cleft broods&mdash;what the after-age</p>
<p>Knows and names a pine, a nation's heritage."</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this sharp division, as in his <i>Epilogue</i> to
<i>Pacchiarotto</i>, he misses the truth. It is almost needless to
say that a poet can be sensitive to beauty, and also to the stern
facts of the moral and spiritual struggle of mankind through evil
to good. All the great poets have been sensitive to both and
mingled them in their work. They were ideal and real in both the
flower and the pine. They are never forced <a name='Page438' id=
"Page438"></a><span class='pagenum'>438</span>to choose one or
other of these aims or lives in their poetry. They mingled facts
and fancies, the intellectual and the imaginative. They lived in
the whole world of the outward and the inward, of the senses and
the soul. Truth and beauty were one to them. This division of which
Browning speaks Was the unfortunate result of that struggle between
his intellect and his imagination on which I have dwelt. In old
days it was not so with him. His early poetry had sweetness with
strength, stern thinking with tender emotion, love of beauty with
love of truth, idealism with realism, nature with humanity, fancy
with fact. And this is the equipment of the great poet. When he
divides these qualities each from the other, and is only
&aelig;sthetic or only severe in his realism; only the worshipper
of Nature or only the worshipper of human nature; only the poet of
beauty or only the poet of austere fact; only the idealist or only
the realist; only of the senses or only of the soul&mdash;he may be
a poet, but not a great poet. And as the singular pursuit of the
realistic is almost always bound up with pride, because realism
does not carry us beyond ourselves into the infinite where we are
humbled, the realistic poetry loses imagination; its love of love
tends to become self-love, or love of mere cleverness. And then its
poetic elements slowly die.</p>
<p>There was that, as I have said, in Browning which resisted this
sad conclusion, but the resistance was not enough to prevent a
great loss of poetic power. But whatever he lost, there was one
poetic temper of mind which never failed him, the heroic temper of
the faithful warrior for God and man; there was one ideal view of
humanity which dominated all his <a name='Page439' id=
"Page439"></a><span class='pagenum'>439</span>work; there was one
principle which directed all his verse to celebrate the struggle of
humanity towards the perfection for which God, he believed, had
destined it. These things underlie all the poems in <i>Ferishtah's
Fancies</i> and the <i>Parleyings with Certain People</i>, and give
to them the uplifted, noble trumpet note with which at times they
are animated. The same temper and principle, the same view of
humanity emerge in that fine lyric which is the Epilogue to
<i>Ferishtah's Fancies</i>, and in the Epilogue to
<i>Asolando</i>.</p>
<p>The first sees a vision of the present and the future in which
all the battle of our life passes into a glorious end; nor does the
momentary doubt that occurs at the close of the poem&mdash;that his
belief in a divine conclusion of our strife may only have been
caused by his own happiness in love&mdash;really trouble his
conviction. That love itself is part of the power which makes the
noble conclusion sure. The certainty of this conclusion made his
courage in the fight unwavering, despair impossible, joy in battle,
duty; and to be "ever a fighter" in the foremost rank the highest
privilege of man.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Then the cloud-rift broadens, spanning earth that's under,</p>
<p class='i2'>Wide our world displays its worth, man's strife and
strife's success:</p>
<p>All the good and beauty, wonder crowning wonder,</p>
<p class='i2'>Till my heart and soul applaud perfection, nothing
less.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>And for that reason, because of the perfectness to come,
Browning lived every hour of his life for good and against wrong.
He said with justice of himself, and with justice he brought the
ideal aim and the real effort together:</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>I looked beyond the world for truth and beauty:</p>
<p class='i1'>Sought, found, and did my duty.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p><a name='Page440' id="Page440"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>440</span>Nor, almost in the very grasp of death, did
this faith fail him. He kept, in the midst of a fretful, slothful,
wailing world, where prophets like Carlyle and Ruskin were as
impatient and bewildered, as lamenting and despondent, as the
decadents they despised, the temper of his Herakles in
<i>Balaustion</i>. He left us that temper as his last legacy, and
he could not have left us a better thing. We may hear it in his
last poem, and bind it about our hearts in sorrow and joy, in
battle and peace, in the hour of death and the days of
judgment.</p>
<div class='poem'>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>At the midnight in the silence of the sleep-time</p>
<p class='i4'>When you set your fancies free,</p>
<p>Will they pass to where&mdash;by death, fools think,
imprisoned&mdash;</p>
<p>Low he lies who once so loved you, whom you loved so</p>
<p class='i20'>&mdash;Pity me?</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>Oh to love so, be so loved, yet so mistaken</p>
<p class='i4'>What had I on earth to do</p>
<p>With the slothful, with the mawkish, the unmanly?</p>
<p>Like the aimless, helpless, hopeless, did I drivel</p>
<p class='i20'>&mdash;Being&mdash;who?</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>One who never turned his back, but marched breast forward,</p>
<p class='i4'>Never doubted clouds would break,</p>
<p>Never dreamed, though right were worsted, wrong would
triumph,</p>
<p>Held we fall to rise, are baffled to fight better,</p>
<p class='i20'>Sleep to wake.</p>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<p>No, at noonday in the bustle of man's work-time</p>
<p class='i4'>Greet the unseen with a cheer!</p>
<p>Bid him forward, breast and back as either should be,</p>
<p>"Strive and thrive!" cry "Speed,&mdash;fight on, fare ever</p>
<p class='i20'>There as here!"</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>With these high words he ended a long life, and his memory still
falls upon us, like the dew which fell on Paradise. It was a life
lived fully, kindly, lovingly, at its just height from the
beginning to the end. No fear, no vanity, no lack of interest, no
<a name='Page441' id="Page441"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>441</span>complaint of the world, no anger at criticism,
no villain fancies disturbed his soul. No laziness, no feebleness
in effort, injured his work, no desire for money, no faltering of
aspiration, no pandering of his gift and genius to please the
world, no surrender of art for the sake of fame or filthy lucre, no
falseness to his ideal, no base pessimism, no slavery to science
yet no boastful ignorance of its good, no morbid naturalism, no
devotion to the false forms of beauty, no despair of man, no
retreat from men into a world of sickly or vain beauty, no
abandonment of the great ideas or disbelief in their mastery, no
enfeeblement of reason such as at this time walks hand in hand with
the worship of the mere discursive intellect, no lack of joy and
healthy vigour and keen inquiry and passionate interest in
humanity. Scarcely any special bias can be found running through
his work; on the contrary, an incessant change of subject and
manner, combined with a strong but not overweening individuality,
raced, like blood through the body, through every vein of his
labour. Creative and therefore joyful, receptive and therefore
thoughtful, at one with humanity and therefore loving; aspiring to
God and believing in God, and therefore steeped to the lips in
radiant Hope; at one with the past, passionate with the present,
and possessing by faith an endless and glorious future&mdash;this
was a life lived on the top of the wave, and moving with its motion
from youth to manhood, from manhood to old age.</p>
<p>There is no need to mourn for his departure. Nothing feeble has
been done, nothing which lowers the note of his life, nothing we
can regret as less than his native strength. His last poem was like
<a name='Page442' id="Page442"></a><span class=
'pagenum'>442</span>the last look of the Phoenix to the sun before
the sunlight lights the odorous pyre from which the new-created
Bird will spring. And as if the Muse of Poetry wished to adorn the
image of his death, he passed away amid a world of beauty, and in
the midst of a world endeared to him by love. Italy was his second
country. In Florence lies the wife of his heart. In every city he
had friends, friends not only among men and women, but friends in
every ancient wall, in every fold of Apennine and Alp, in every
breaking of the blue sea, in every forest of pines, in every Church
and Palace and Town Hall, in every painting that great art had
wrought, in every storied market place, in every great life which
had adorned, honoured and made romantic Italy; the great mother of
Beauty, at whose breasts have hung and whose milk have sucked all
the arts and all the literatures of modern Europe. Venice saw and
mourned his death. The sea and sky and mountain glory of the city
he loved so well encompassed him with her beauty; and their soft
graciousness, their temperate power of joy and life made his
departure peaceful. Strong and tender in life, his death added a
new fairness to his life. Mankind is fortunate to have so noble a
memory, so full and excellent a work to rest upon and love.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
